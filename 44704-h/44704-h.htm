<h3>The Spectator</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Spectator," the most popular and elegant miscellany of
English literature, appeared on the 1st of March, 1711. With
an interruption of two years&mdash;1712 to 1714&mdash;during part of
which time "The Guardian," a similar periodical, took its place,
"The Spectator" was continued to the 20th of December, 1714.
Addison's fame is inseparably associated with this periodical.
He was the animating spirit of the magazine, and by far the
most exquisite essays which appear in it are by him. Richard
Steele, Addison's friend and coadjutor in "The Spectator," was
born in Dublin in March, 1672, and died at Carmarthen on September
1, 1729. (Addison biography, see Vol. XVI, p. 1.)</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>The Essays and the Essayist</i></h4>

<p>Addison's "Spectator" is one of the most interesting
books in the English language. When Dr. Johnson
praised Addison's prose, it was specially of "The Spectator"
that he was speaking. "His page," he says, "is
always luminous, but never blazes in unexpected splendour.
His sentences have neither studied amplitude nor
affected brevity; his periods, though not diligently
rounded, are voluble and easy. Whoever wishes to attain
an English style, familiar but not coarse, and elegant
but not ostentatious, must give his days and nights to
Addison."</p>

<p>Johnson's verdict has been upheld, for it is chiefly by
"The Spectator" that Addison lives. None but scholars
know his Latin verse and his voluminous translations
now. His "Cato" survives only in some half-dozen occasional
quotations. Two or three hymns of his, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
"The spacious firmament on high," and "When all
Thy mercies, O my God," find a place in church collections;
and his simile of the angel who rides upon the
whirlwind and directs the storm is used now and again
by pressmen and public speakers. But, in the main, when
we think of Addison, it is of "The Spectator" that we
think.</p>

<p>Recall the time when it was founded. It was in the
days of Queen Anne, the Augustan age of the essay.
There were no newspapers then, no magazines or reviews,
no Parliamentary reports, nothing corresponding
to the so-called "light literature" of later days. The
only centres of society that existed were the court, with
the aristocracy that revolved about it, and the clubs and
coffee-houses, in which the commercial and professional
classes met to discuss matters of general interest, to
crack their jokes, and to exchange small talk about this,
that and the other person, man or woman, who might
happen to figure, publicly or privately, at the time. "The
Spectator" was one of the first organs to give form and
consistency to the opinion, the humour and the gossip engendered
by this social contact.</p>

<p>One of the first, but not quite the first; for the less
famous, though still remembered, "Tatler" preceded it.
And these two, "The Tatler" and "The Spectator," have
an intimate connection from the circumstance that Richard
Steele, who started "The Tatler" in April, 1709, got
Addison to write for it, and then joined with Addison in
"The Spectator" when his own paper stopped in January,
1711. Addison and Steele had been friends since
boyhood. They were contemporaries at the Charterhouse,
and Steele often spent his holidays in the parsonage
of Addison's father.</p>

<p>The two friends were a little under forty years of age
when "The Spectator" began in March, 1711. It was a
penny paper, and was published daily, its predecessor having
been published three times a week. It began with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
circulation of 3,000 copies, and ran up to about 10,000
before it stopped its daily issue in December, 1712. Macaulay,
writing in 1843, insists upon the sale as "indicating
a popularity quite as great as that of the most successful
works of Scott and Dickens in our time." The 555
numbers of the daily issue formed seven volumes; and
then there was a final eighth volume, made up of triweekly
issues: a total of 635 numbers, of which Addison
wrote 274, and Steele 236.</p>

<p>To summarise the contents of these 635 numbers
would require a volume. They are so versatile and so
varied. As one of Addison's biographers puts it, to-day
you have a beautiful meditation, brilliant in imagery and
serious as a sermon, or a pious discourse on death, or
perhaps an eloquent and scathing protest against the
duel; while to-morrow the whole number is perhaps concerned
with the wigs, ruffles, and shoe-buckles of the
<em>macaroni</em>, or the hoops, patches, farthingales and tuckers
of the ladies. If you wish to see the plays and actors
of the time, "The Spectator" will always show them to
you; and, moreover, point out the dress, manners, and
mannerisms, affectations, indecorums, plaudits, or otherwise
of the frequenters of the theatre.</p>

<p>For here is no newspaper, as we understand the term.
"The Spectator" from the first indulged his humours
at the expense of the quidnuncs. Says he:</p>

<p>"There is another set of men that I must likewise lay
a claim to as being altogether unfurnished with ideas till
the business and conversation of the day has supplied
them. I have often considered these poor souls with an
eye of great commiseration when I have heard them asking
the first man they have met with whether there was
any news stirring, and by that means gathering together
materials for thinking. These needy persons do not know
what to talk of till about twelve o'clock in the morning;
for by that time they are pretty good judges of the
weather, know which way the wind sets, and whether the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Dutch mail be come in. As they lie at the mercy of the
first man they meet, and are grave or impertinent all the
day long, according to the notions which they have imbibed
in the morning, I would earnestly entreat them not
to stir out of their chambers till they have read this paper;
and do promise them that I will daily instil into them
such sound and wholesome sentiments as shall have a
good effect on their conversation for the ensuing twelve
hours."</p>

<p>Now, the essential, or at least the leading feature of
"The Spectator" is this: that the entertainment is provided
by an imaginary set of characters forming a Spectator
Club. The club represents various classes or sections
of the community, so that through its members a
corresponding variety of interests and opinions is set before
the reader, the Spectator himself acting as a sort of
final censor or referee. Chief among the Club members
is Sir Roger de Coverley, a simple, kindly, honourable,
old-world country gentleman. Here is the description of
this celebrated character:</p>

<p>"The first of our society is a gentleman of Worcestershire,
of ancient descent, a baronet, his name Sir Roger
de Coverley. His great-grandfather was inventor of that
famous country dance which is called after him. All
who know that shire are very well acquainted with the
parts and merits of Sir Roger. He is a gentleman that
is very singular in his behaviour, but his singularities
proceed from his good sense, and are contradictions to
the manners of the world only as he thinks the world is
in the wrong. However, this humour creates him no
enemies, for he does nothing with sourness or obstinacy;
and his being unconfined to modes and forms makes him
but the readier and more capable to please and oblige all
who know him. When he is in town, he lives in Soho
Square. It is said he keeps himself a bachelor by reason
he was crossed in love by a perverse beautiful widow of
the next county to him. Before this disappointment, Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Roger was what you call a fine gentleman, had often
supped with my Lord Rochester and Sir George Etherege,
fought a duel upon his first coming to town, and kicked
Bully Dawson in a public coffee-house for calling him
youngster. But being ill-used by the above-mentioned
widow, he was very serious for a year and a half; and
though, his temper being naturally jovial, he at last got
over it, he grew careless of himself, and never dressed
afterwards. He continues to wear a coat and doublet
of the same cut that were in fashion at the time of his
repulse, which, in his merry humours, he tells us, has been
in and out twelve times since he first wore it. It is said
Sir Roger grew humble in his desires after he had forgot
this cruel beauty, insomuch that it is reported he was
frequently offended with beggars and gipsies; but this is
looked upon by his friends rather as matter of raillery
than truth. He is now in his fifty-sixth year, cheerful,
gay, and hearty; keeps a good house both in town and
country; a great lover of mankind; but there is such a
mirthful cast in his behaviour that he is rather beloved
than esteemed."</p>

<p>Then there is Sir Andrew Freeport, "a merchant of
great eminence in the City of London; a person of indefatigable
industry, strong reason, and great experience."
He is "acquainted with commerce in all its parts; and
will tell you it is a stupid and barbarous way to extend
dominion by arms; for true power is to be got by arts
and industry. He will often argue that, if this part of
our trade were well cultivated, we should gain from one
nation; and if another, from another."</p>

<p>There is Captain Sentry, too, "a gentleman of great
courage and understanding, but invincible modesty," who
in the club speaks for the army, as the templar does for
taste and learning, and the clergyman for theology and
philosophy.</p>

<p>And then, that the club may not seem to be unacquainted
with "the gallantries and pleasures of the age,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
there is Will Honeycomb, the elderly man of fashion, who
is "very ready at that sort of discourse with which men
usually entertain women." Will "knows the history of
every mode, and can inform you from which of the
French king's wenches our wives and daughters had this
manner of curling their hair, that way of placing their
hoods; whose frailty was covered by such a sort of petticoat;
and whose vanity to show her foot made that part
of the dress so short in such a year. In a word, all his
conversation and knowledge have been in the female
world. As other men of his age will take notice to you
what such a minister said upon such and such an occasion,
he will tell you when the Duke of Monmouth danced at
court, such a woman was then smitten, another was taken
with him at the head of his troop in the park. This way
of talking of his very much enlivens the conversation
among us of a more sedate turn; and I find there is not
one of the company, but myself, who rarely speak at all,
but speaks of him as that sort of man who is usually called
a well-bred fine gentleman. To conclude his character,
where women are not concerned, he is an honest, worthy
man."</p>

<p>Nor must we forget Will Wimble, though he is really
an outsider. Will is the younger son of a baronet: a man
of no profession, looking after his father's game, training
his dogs, shooting, fishing, hunting, making whiplashes
for his neighbors, knitting garters for the ladies, and
afterwards slyly inquiring how they wear: a welcome
guest at every house in the county; beloved by all the lads
and the children.</p>

<p>Besides these, and others, there is a fine little gallery of
portraits in Sir Roger's country neighbours and tenants.
We have, for instance, the yeoman who "knocks down a
dinner with his gun twice or thrice a week, and by that
means lives much cheaper than those who have not so
good an estate as himself"; and we have Moll White, the
reputed witch, who, if she made a mistake at church and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
cried "Amen!" in a wrong place, "they never failed to
conclude that she was saying her prayers backwards."
We have the diverting captain, "young, sound, and impudent";
we have a demure Quaker; we have Tom
Touchy, a fellow famous for "taking the law" of everybody;
and we have the inn-keeper, who, out of compliment
to Sir Roger, "put him up in a sign-post before the
door," and then, when Sir Roger objected, changed the
figure into the Saracen's Head by "a little aggravation
of the features" and the addition of a pair of whiskers!</p>

<p>Best of all is the old chaplain. Sir Roger was "afraid
of being insulted with Latin and Greek at his own table";
so he got a university friend to "find him out a clergyman,
rather of plain sense than much learning, of a good
aspect, a clear voice, a sociable temper, and, if possible,
a man that understood a little of backgammon." The
genial knight "made him a present of all the good sermons
printed in English, and only begged of him that
every Sunday he would pronounce one of them in the
pulpit." Thus, if Sir Roger happened to meet his chaplain
on a Saturday evening, and asked who was to preach
to-morrow, he would perhaps be answered: "The Bishop
of St. Asaph in the morning, and Dr. South in the afternoon."
About which arrangement "The Spectator"
boldly observes: "I could heartily wish that more of our
country clergy would follow this example; and, instead
of wasting their spirits in laborious compositions of their
own, would endeavour after a handsome elocution, and
all those other talents that are proper to enforce what has
been penned by greater masters. This would not only
be more easy to themselves, but more edifying to the
people."</p>

<p>There is no end to the subjects discussed by "The
Spectator." They range from dreams to dress and duelling;
from ghosts to gardening and goats' milk; from wigs
to wine and widows; from religion to riches and riding;
from servants to sign-posts and snuff-boxes; from love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
to lodgings and lying; from beards to bankruptcy and
blank verse; and hundreds of other interesting themes.
Correspondents often wrote to emphasise this variety, for
letters from the outside public were always welcome.
Thus one "Thomas Trusty":</p>

<p>"The variety of your subjects surprises me as much as
a box of pictures did formerly, in which there was only
one face, that by pulling some pieces of isinglass over it
was changed into a senator or a merry-andrew, a polished
lady or a nun, a beau or a blackamoor, a prude or a
coquette, a country squire or a conjurer, with many other
different representations very entertaining, though still
the same at the bottom."</p>

<p>But perhaps, on the whole, woman and her little ways
have the predominant attention. Indeed, Addison expressly
avowed this object of engaging the special interests
of the sex when he started. He says:</p>

<p>"There are none to whom this paper will be more useful
than to the female world. I have often thought that
there has not been sufficient pains taken in finding out
proper employments and diversions for the fair ones.
Their amusements seem contrived for them rather as they
are women than as they are reasonable creatures; and are
more adapted to the sex than to the species. The toilet
is their great scene of business, and the right adjustment
of their hair the principal employment of their lives. The
sorting of a suit of ribands is reckoned a very good morning's
work; and if they make an excursion to a mercer's
or a toy-shop, so great a fatigue makes them unfit for
anything else all the day after. Their more serious occupations
are sewing and embroidery, and their greatest
drudgery the preparations of jellies and sweetmeats.
This, I say, is the state of ordinary women; though I
know there are multitudes of those of a more elevated
life and conversation, that move in an exalted sphere of
knowledge and virtue, that join all the beauties of the
mind to the ornaments of dress, and inspire a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
awe and respect, as well as of love, into their male beholders.
I hope to increase the number of these by publishing
this daily paper, which I shall always endeavour
to make an innocent, if not an improving, entertainment,
and by that means, at least, divert the minds of my female
readers from greater trifles."</p>

<p>These reflections on the manners of women did not
quite please Swift, who wrote to Stella: "I will not
meddle with 'The Spectator'; let him <em>fair sex</em> it to the
world's end." But they pleased most other people, as
the main contents of "The Spectator" still please. Here
is one typical acknowledgment, signed "Leonora":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. Spectator,&mdash;Your paper is part of my tea-equipage; and
my servant knows my humour so well that, calling for my breakfast
this morning (it being past my usual hour), she answered,
"'the Spectator' was not yet come in, but the tea-kettle boiled,
and she expected it every moment."</p></blockquote>

<p>As an "abstract and brief chronicle of the time," this
monumental work of Addison and Steele is without peer.
In its pages may be traced the foundations of all that is
noble and healthy in modern English thought; and its
charming sketches may be made the open sesame to a
period and a literature as rich as any our country has seen.</p>

<h2 id="ch_10"><a name="AESOP" id="AESOP">Ã†SOP</a></h2>

<h3>Fables</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>It is in the fitness of things that the early biographies of
Ã†sop, the great fabulist, should be entirely fabulous. Macrobius
has distinguished between <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">fabula</i> and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">fabulosa narratio</i>:
"He would have a fable to be absolutely false, and a fabulous
narration to be a number of fictions built upon a foundation of
truth." The Lives of Ã†sop belong chiefly to the latter category.
In the following pages what is known of the life of
Ã†sop is set forth, together with condensed versions of some
of his most characteristic fables, which have long passed into
the wisdom of all nations, this being a subject that calls for
treatment on somewhat different lines from the majority of the
works dealt with in <span class="smcap">The World's Greatest Books</span>.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>Introductory</i></h4>

<p>Pierre Bayle, in his judicious fashion, sums up what
is said of Ã†sop in antiquity, resting chiefly upon Plutarch.
"Plutarch affirms: (1) That CrÅ“sus sent Ã†sop
to Periander, the Tyrant of Corinth, and to the Oracle
of Delphi; (2) that Socrates found no other expedient
to obey the God of Dreams, without injuring his profession,
than to turn the Fables of Ã†sop into verse; (3)
that Ã†sop and Solon were together at the Court of
CrÅ“sus, King of Lydia; (4) that those of Delphi, having
put Ã†sop to death cruelly and unjustly, and finding
themselves exposed to several calamities on account of
this injustice, made a public declaration that they were
ready to make satisfaction to the memory of Ã†sop; (5)
that having treated thereupon with a native of Samos,
they were delivered from the evil that afflicted them."</p>

<p>To this summary Bayle added a footnote concerning
"The Life of Ã†sop, composed by Meziriac": "It is a
little book printed at Bourg-en-Bress, in 1632. It contains
only forty pages in 16. It is becoming exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
scarce.... This is what I extract from it. It is
more probable that Ã†sop was born at CotiÅ“um, a town
of Phrygia, than that he was born at Sardis, or in the
island of Samos, or at Mesembria in Thrace. The first
master that he served was one Zemarchus, or Demarchus,
surnamed Carasius, a native and inhabitant of Athens.
Thus it is probable that it was there he learned the
purity of the Greek tongue, as in its spring, and acquired
the knowledge of moral philosophy which was then in
esteem....</p>

<p>"In process of time he was sold to Xanthus, a native
of the Isle of Samos, and afterwards to Idmon, or Iadmnon,
the philosopher, who was a Samian also, and who
enfranchised him. After he had recovered his liberty,
he soon acquired a great reputation among the Greeks;
so that the report of his singular wisdom having reached
the ears of CrÅ“sus, he sent to inquire after him; and
having conceived an affection for him, he obliged him by
his favours to engage himself in his service to the end of
his life. He travelled through Greece&mdash;whether for his
own pleasure or for the private affairs of CrÅ“sus is uncertain&mdash;and
passing by Athens, soon after Pisistratus
had usurped the sovereign power there and had abolished
the popular state, and seeing that the Athenians bore the
yoke very impatiently, he told them the Fable of the
Frogs that asked a King of Jupiter. Afterwards he met
the Seven Wise Men in the City of Corinth at the Tyrant
Periander's. Some relate that, in order to show that the
life of man is full of miseries, and that one pleasure is
attended with a thousand pains, Ã†sop used to say that
when Prometheus took the clay to form man, he did not
temper it with water, but with tears."</p>

<p>Concerning the death of this extraordinary man we
read that Ã†sop went to Delphi, with a great quantity of
gold and silver, being ordered by CrÅ“sus to offer a great
sacrifice to Apollo, and to give a considerable sum to
each inhabitant. The quarrel which arose between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Delphians and him was the occasion, after his sending
away the sacrifice, of his sending back the money to
CrÅ“sus; for he thought that those for whom this prince
designed it had rendered themselves unworthy of it.
The inhabitants of Delphi contrived an accusation of
sacrilege against him, and, pretending that they had convicted
him, cast him down from the top of a rock.</p>

<p>Bayle has a long line of centuries at his back when he
says: "Ã†sop's lectures against the faults of men were
the fullest of good sense and wit that can be imagined."
He substantiates this affirmation in the following manner:
"Can any inventions be more happy than the images
Ã†sop made use of to instruct mankind? They are exceedingly
fit for children, and no less proper for grown
persons; they are all that is necessary to perfect a precept
&mdash;I mean the mixture of the useful with the agreeable."
He then quotes Aulus Gellius as saying: "Ã†sop
the Phrygian fabulist was not without reason esteemed
to be wise, since he did not, after the manner of the philosophers,
severely and imperiously command such things
as were fit to be advised and persuaded, but by feigning,
diverting and entertaining apologues, he insinuates good
and wholesome advice into the minds of men with a
kind of willing attention."</p>

<p>Bayle continues: "At all times these have been made
to succeed the homespun stories of nurses. 'Let them
learn to tell the Fables of Ã†scop, which succeed the stories
of the nursery, in pure and easy style, and afterwards
endeavour to write in the same familiar manner.' They
have never fallen into contempt. Our age, notwithstanding
its pride and delicacy, esteems and admires them, and
shows them in a hundred different shapes. The inimitable
La Fontaine has procured them in our time a great
deal of honour and glory; and great commendations are
given to the reflections of an English wit, Sir Roger
L'Estrange, on these very fables."</p>

<p>Since the period when Pierre Bayle composed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
great biographical dictionary, the Fables of Ã†sop have
perhaps suffered something of a relapse in the favour of
grown persons; but if one may judge from the number
of new editions illustrated for children, they are still the
delight of modern nurseries. There is this, however, to
be said of contemporary times&mdash;that the multitude of
books in a nursery prevent children from acquiring the
profound and affectionate acquaintance with Ã†sop which
every child would naturally get when his fables were
almost the only book provided by the Press for juvenile
readers.</p>

<p>It is questionable whether the fables will any longer
produce the really deep effect which they certainly have
had in the past. But we may be certain that some of them
will always play a great part in the wisdom of the common
people, and that these particularly true and striking
apologues are secure of an eternal place in the literature
of nations. As an example of what we mean, we will
tell as simply as possible some of the most characteristic
fables.</p>

<h4><i>The Dog and the Shadow</i></h4>

<p>A Dog, with a piece of stolen meat between his teeth,
was one day crossing a river by means of a plank, when
he caught sight of another dog in the water carrying a far
larger piece of meat. He opened his jaws to snap at the
greater morsel, when the meat dropped in the stream
and was lost even in the reflection.</p>

<h4><i>The Dying Lion</i></h4>

<p>A Lion, brought to the extremity of weakness by old
age and disease, lay dying in the sunlight. Those whom
he had oppressed in his strength now came round about
him to revenge themselves for past injuries. The Boar
ripped the flank of the King of Beasts with his tusks.
The Bull came and gored the Lion's sides with his horns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Finally, the Ass drew near, and after carefully seeing that
there was no danger, let fly with his heels in the Lion's
face. Then, with a dying groan, the mighty creature
exclaimed: "How much worse it is than a thousand
deaths to be spurned by so base a creature!"</p>

<h4><i>The Mountain in Labour</i></h4>

<p>A Mountain was heard to produce dreadful sounds,
as though it were labouring to bring forth something
enormous. The people came and stood about waiting to
see what wonderful thing would be produced from this
labour. After they had waited till they were tired, out
crept a Mouse.</p>

<h4><i>Hercules and the Waggoner</i></h4>

<p>A Waggoner was driving his team through a muddy
lane when the wheels stuck fast in the clay, and the
Horses could get no farther. The Man immediately
dropped on his knees, and, crying bitterly, besought Hercules
to come and help him. "Get up and stir thyself,
thou lazy fellow!" replied Hercules. "Whip thy Horses,
and put thy shoulder to the wheel. If thou art in need
of my help, when thou thyself hast laboured, then shalt
thou have it."</p>

<h4><i>The Frogs that Asked for a King</i></h4>

<p>The Frogs, who lived an easy, happy life in the ponds,
once prayed to Jupiter that he should give them a King.
Jupiter was amused by this prayer, and cast a log into
the water, saying: "There, then, is a King for you."
The Frogs, frightened by the great splash, regarded their
King with alarm, until at last, seeing that he did not stir,
some of them jumped upon his back and began to be
merry there, amused at such a foolish King. However,
King Log did not satisfy their ideas for very long, and
so once again they petitioned Jupiter to send them a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
King, a real King who would rule over them, and not lie
helpless in the water. Then Jupiter sent the Frogs a
Stork, who caught them by their legs, tossed them in the
air, and gobbled them up whenever he was hungry. All
in a hurry the Frogs besought Jupiter to take away King
Stork and restore them to their former happy condition.
"No, no," answered Jupiter; "a King that did you no
hurt did not please you; make the best of him you now
have, lest a worse come in his place!"</p>

<h4><i>The Gnat and the Lion</i></h4>

<p>A lively and insolent Gnat was bold enough to attack
a Lion, which he so maddened by stinging the most sensitive
parts of his nose, eyes and ears that the beast roared
with anguish and tore himself with his claws. In vain
were the Lion's efforts to rid himself of his insignificant
tormentor; again and again the insect returned and
stung the furious King of Beasts, till at last the Lion fell
exhausted on the ground. The triumphant Gnat, sounding
his tiny trumpet, hovered over the spot exulting in
his victory. But it happened that in his circling flight
he got himself caught in the web of a Spider, which,
fine and delicate as it was, yet had power enough to hold
the tiny insect a prisoner. All the Gnat's efforts to escape
only held him the more tightly and firmly a prisoner, and
he who had conquered the Lion became in his turn the
prey of the Spider.</p>

<h4><i>The Wolf and the Stork</i></h4>

<p>A Wolf ate his food so greedily that a bone stuck in
his throat. This caused him such great pain that he ran
hither and thither, promising to reward handsomely
anyone who would remove the cause of his torture. A
Stork, moved with pity by the Wolf's cry of pain, and
tempted also by the reward, undertook the dangerous
operation. When he had removed the bone, the Wolf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
moved away, but the Stork called out and reminded him
of the promised reward. "Reward!" exclaimed the
Wolf. "Pray, you greedy fellow, what reward can you
expect? You dared to put your head in my mouth,
and instead of biting it off, I let you take it out again
unharmed. Get away with you! And do not again place
yourself in my power."</p>

<h4><i>The Frog who Wanted to Be as Big as an Ox</i></h4>

<p>A vain Frog, surrounded by her children, looked up
and saw an Ox grazing near by. "I can be as big as the
Ox," she said, and began to blow herself out. "Am I as
big now?" she inquired. "Oh, no; not nearly so big!"
said the little frogs. "Now?" she asked, blowing herself
out still more. "No, not nearly so big!" answered
her children. "But now?" she inquired eagerly, and
blew herself out still more. "No, not even now," they
said; "and if you try till you burst yourself you will
never be so big." But the Frog would not listen, and
attempting to make herself bigger still, burst her skin
and died.</p>

<h4><i>The Dog in the Manger</i></h4>

<p>A Dog lay in a manger which was full of hay. An
Ox, being hungry, came near, and was about to eat when
the Dog started up, and, with angry snarls, would not
let the Ox approach. "Surly brute," said the Ox; "you
cannot eat the hay yourself, and you will let no one else
have any."</p>

<h4><i>The Bundle of Faggots</i></h4>

<p>An honest Man had the unhappiness to have a quarrelsome
family of children. One day he called them before
him, and bade them try to break a bundle of faggots.
All tried, and all failed. "Now," said he, "unbind the
bundle and take every stick by itself, and see if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
cannot break them." They did his bidding, and snapped
all the sticks one by one with the greatest possible ease.
"This, my children," said the Father at last, "is a true
emblem of your condition. Keep together and you are
safe, divide and you are undone."</p>

<h4><i>The Fox Without a Tail</i></h4>

<p>A Fox was once caught in a trap by his tail, and in
order to get free was obliged to leave it behind. He
knew that his fellows would make fun of his tailless
condition, so he made up his mind to induce them all to
part with their tails. At the next assemblage of Foxes he
made a speech on the uselessness of tails in general, and
the inconvenience of a Fox's tail in particular, declaring
that never in his whole life had he felt so comfortable
as now in his tailless freedom. When he sat down, a
sly old Fox rose, and, waving his brush, said, with a
sneer, that if he had lost his tail, he would be convinced
by the last speaker's arguments, but until such an accident
occurred he fully intended to vote in favour of
tails.</p>

<h4><i>The Blind Man and the Paralytic</i></h4>

<p>A blind man finding himself stopped in a rough and
difficult road, met with a paralytic and begged his assistance.
"How can I help you," replied the paralytic,
"when I can scarcely move myself along?" But, regarding
the blind man, he added: "However, you appear
to have good legs and a broad back, and, if you will lift
me and carry me, I will guide you safely through this
difficulty, which is more than each one can surmount for
himself. You shall walk for me, and I will see for you."
"With all my heart," rejoined the blind man; and, taking
the paralytic on his shoulders, the two went cheerfully
forward in a wise partnership which triumphed over all
difficulties.</p>

<h2 id="ch_18"><a name="MATTHEW_ARNOLD" id="MATTHEW_ARNOLD">MATTHEW ARNOLD</a></h2>

<h3>Essays in Criticism</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Matthew Arnold, son of Dr. Arnold of Rugby (see Vol. X,
p. 260), was born on December 24, 1822, and died on April 15,
1888. He was by everyday calling an inspector of schools and
an educational expert, but by nature and grace a poet, a philosopher,
a man of piety and of letters. Arnold almost ceased
to write verse when he was forty-five, though not without
having already produced some of the choicest poetry in the English
language. Before that he had developed his theories of
literary criticism in his "Essays in Criticism"; and about the
time of his withdrawal from Oxford he published "Culture
and Anarchy," in which his system of philosophy is broadly
outlined. Later, in "St. Paul and Protestantism," "Literature
and Dogma" and "God and the Bible," he tried to adjust
Christianity according to the light of modern knowledge. In
his "Lectures on Translating Homer," he had expressed views
on criticism and its importance that were new to, and so were
somewhat adversely discussed by the Press. Whereupon, in 1865,
with a militant joy, he re-entered the fray and defined the province
of criticism in the first of a series of "Essays in Criticism,"
showing the narrowness of the British conception. "The Literary
Influence of Academies" was a subject that enabled him to
make a further comparison between the literary genius of the
French and of the English people, and a number of individual
critiques that followed only enhanced his great and now undisputed
position both as a poet and as a critic. The argument
of the two general essays is given here.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;Creative Power and Critical Power</i></h4>

<p>Many objections have been made to a proposition of
mine about criticism: "Of the literature of France and
Germany, as of the intellect of Europe in general, the
main effort, for now many years, has been a critical
effort&mdash;the endeavour, in all branches of knowledge, to
see the object as in itself it really is." I added that
"almost the last thing for which one would come to
English literature was just that very thing which now
Europe most desired&mdash;criticism," and that the power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
and value of English literature were thereby impaired.
More than one rejoinder declared that the importance
here again assigned to criticism was excessive, and asserted
the inherent superiority of the creative effort of the
human spirit over its critical effort. A reporter of
Wordsworth's conversation quotes a judgment to the
same effect: "Wordsworth holds the critical power very
low; indeed, infinitely lower than the inventive."</p>

<p>The critical power is of lower rank than the inventive&mdash;true;
but, in assenting to this proposition, we must
keep in mind that men may have the sense of exercising
a free creative activity in other ways than in producing
great works of literature or art; and that the exercise of
the creative power in the production of great works of
literature or art is not at all epochs and under all conditions
possible. This creative power works with elements,
with materials&mdash;what if it has not those materials ready
for its use? Now, in literature, the elements with which
creative power works are ideas&mdash;the best ideas on every
matter which literature touches, current at the time. The
grand work of literary genius is a work of synthesis and
exposition; its gift lies in the faculty of being happily
inspired by a certain intellectual and spiritual atmosphere,
by a certain order of ideas, when it finds itself in them;
of dealing divinely with these ideas, presenting them in
most effective and attractive combinations, making beautiful
works with them, in short. But it must have the
atmosphere, it must find itself amidst the order of the
ideas, in order to work freely; and these it is not so
easy to command. This is really why great creative
epochs in literature are so rare&mdash;because, for the creation
of a master-work of literature two powers must concur,
the power of the man and the power of the moment;
and the man is not enough without the moment.</p>

<p>The creative power has for its happy exercise appointed
elements, and those elements are not in its control.
Nay, they are more within the control of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
critical power. It is the business of the critical power
in all branches of knowledge to see the object as in
itself it really is. Thus it tends at last to make an intellectual
situation of which the creative power can avail
itself. It tends to establish an order of ideas, if not
absolutely true, yet true by comparison with that which
it displaces&mdash;to make the best ideas prevail. Presently
these new ideas reach society; the touch of truth is the
touch of life; and there is a stir and growth everywhere.
Out of this stir and growth come the creative epochs of
literature.</p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;The Literary "Atmosphere"</i></h4>

<p>It has long seemed to me that the burst of creative
activity in our literature through the first quarter of the
nineteenth century had about it something premature,
and for this cause its productions are doomed to prove
hardly more lasting than the productions of far less
splendid epochs. And this prematureness comes from its
having proceeded without having its proper data, without
sufficient materials to work with. In other words,
the English poetry of the first quarter of the nineteenth
century, with plenty of energy, plenty of creative force,
did not know enough. This makes Byron so empty of
matter, Shelley so incoherent, Wordsworth, profound as
he is, so wanting in completeness and variety.</p>

<p>It was not really books and reading that lacked to our
poetry at this epoch. Shelley had plenty of reading,
Coleridge had immense reading; Pindar and Sophocles
had not many books; Shakespeare was no deep reader.
True; but in the Greece of Pindar and Sophocles and the
England of Shakespeare the poet lived in a current of
ideas in the highest degree animating and nourishing to
creative power.</p>

<p>Such an atmosphere the many-sided learning and the
long and widely combined critical effort of Germany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
formed for Goethe when he lived and worked. In the
England of the first quarter of the nineteenth century
there was neither a national glow of life and thought,
such as we had in the age of Elizabeth, nor yet a force
of learning and criticism, such as was to be found in
Germany. The creative power of poetry wanted, for
success in the highest sense, materials and a basis&mdash;a
thorough interpretation of the world was necessarily
denied to it.</p>

<p>At first it seems strange that out of the immense stir
of the French Revolution and its age should not have
come a crop of works of genius equal to that which
came out of the stir of the great productive time of
Greece, or out of that of the Renaissance, with its powerful
episode of the Reformation. But the truth is that
the stir of the French Revolution took a character which
essentially distinguished it from such movements as
these. The French Revolution found, undoubtedly, its
motive power in the intelligence of men, and not in their
practical sense. It appeals to an order of ideas which are
universal, certain, permanent. The year 1789 asked of
a thing: Is it rational? That a whole nation should have
been penetrated with an enthusiasm for pure reason is a
very remarkable thing when we consider how little of
mind, or anything so worthy or quickening as mind,
comes into the motives which in general impel great
masses of men. In spite of the crimes and follies in
which it lost itself, the French Revolution derives, from
the force, truth and universality of the ideas which it
took for its law, a unique and still living power; and it
is, and will probably long remain, the greatest, the most
animating event in history.</p>

<p>But the mania for giving an immediate political and
practical application to all these fine ideas of the reason
was fatal. Here an Englishman is in his element: on
this theme we can all go on for hours. Ideas cannot be
too much prized in and for themselves, cannot be too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
much lived with; but to transport them abruptly into the
world of politics and practice, violently to revolutionise
this world to their bidding&mdash;that is quite another thing.
"Force and right are the governors of the world; force
till right is ready" Joubert has said. The grand error
of the French Revolution was that it set at naught the
second great half of that maxim&mdash;force till right is
ready&mdash;and, rushing furiously into the political sphere,
created in opposition to itself what I may call an epoch of
concentration.</p>

<p>The great force of that epoch of concentration was
England, and the great voice of that epoch of concentration
was Burke. I will not deny that his writings are
often disfigured by the violence and passion of the
moment, and that in some directions Burke's view was
bounded and his observations therefore at fault; but for
those who can make the needful corrections what distinguishes
these writings is their profound, permanent,
fruitful, philosophical truth&mdash;they contain the true philosophy
of an epoch of concentration. Now, an epoch of
expansion seems to be opening in this country. In spite
of the absorbing and brutalising influence of our passionate
material progress, this progress is likely to lead in
the end to an apparition of intellectual life. It is of
the last importance that English criticism should discern
what rule it ought to take, to avail itself of the field now
opening to it. That rule may be summed up in one word&mdash;disinterestedness.</p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;The Virtue of Detachment</i></h4>

<p>How is criticism to show disinterestedness? By keeping
aloof from practice; by resolutely following the law
of its own nature, which is to be a free play of the mind
on all subjects which it touches. Its business is simply to
know the best that is known and thought in the world,
and by making this known to create a current of fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
and true ideas. What is at present the bane of criticism
in this country? It is that our organs of criticism are
organs of men and parties having practical ends to serve,
and with them those practical ends are the first thing,
and the play of the mind the second&mdash;so much play of
mind as is compatible with the prosecution of these practical
ends is all that is wanted.</p>

<p>An organ like the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, existing
as just an organ for a free play of mind, we have not;
but we have the "Edinburgh Review," existing as an
organ of the old Whigs, and for as much play of mind
as may suit its being that; we have the "Quarterly Review,"
existing as an organ of the Tories, and for as
much play of mind as may suit its being that; we have
the "British Quarterly Review," existing as an organ
of the political Dissenters, and for as much play of mind
as may suit its being that; we have "The Times," existing
as an organ of the common, satisfied, well-to-do
Englishman, and for as much play of mind as may suit
its being that. And so on through all the various fractions,
political and religious, of our society&mdash;every fraction
has, as such, its organ of criticism, but the notion of
combining all fractions in the common pleasure of a free,
disinterested play of mind meets with no favour. Yet
no other criticism will ever attain any real authority, or
make any real way towards its end&mdash;the creating of a
current of true and fresh ideas.</p>

<p>It will be said that, by embracing in this manner the
Indian virtue of detachment, criticism condemns itself to
a slow and obscure work; but it is the only proper work
of criticism. Whoever sets himself to see things as they
are will find himself one of a very small circle; but it is
only by this small circle resolutely doing its work that
adequate ideas will ever get current at all. For the practical
man is not apt for fine distinctions, and yet in these
distinctions truth and the highest culture greatly find
their account. To act is so easy, as Goethe says, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
think is so hard. Criticism must maintain its independence
of the practical spirit and its aims. Even with
well meant efforts of the practical spirit it must express
dissatisfaction if, in the sphere of the ideal, they seem
impoverishing and limiting. It must be apt to study and
praise elements that for the fulness of spiritual perfection
are wanted, even though they belong to a power
which, in the practical sphere, may be maleficent. It must
be apt to discern the spiritual shortcomings of powers
that in the practical sphere may be beneficent.</p>

<p>By the very nature of things much of the best that
is known and thought in the world cannot be of English
growth&mdash;must be foreign; by the nature of things, again,
it is just this that we are least likely to know, while English
thought is streaming in upon us from all sides, and
takes excellent care that we shall not be ignorant of its
existence. The English critic must dwell much on foreign
thought, and with particular heed on any part of it,
which, while significant and fruitful in itself, is for any
reason specially likely to escape him.</p>

<p>Again, judging is often spoken of as the critic's business;
and so in some sense it is. But the judgment which
almost insensibly forms itself in a fair and clear mind,
along with fresh knowledge, is the valuable one; and,
therefore, knowledge, and ever fresh knowledge, must
be the critic's great concern for himself. And it is by
communicating fresh knowledge, and letting his own
judgment pass along with it&mdash;as a sort of companion
and clue&mdash;that he will generally do most good to his
readers.</p>

<p>To get near the standard of the best that is known and
thought in the world, every critic should possess one great
literature at least beside his own; and the more unlike
his own the better. For the criticism I am concerned
with regards Europe as being for intellectual and spiritual
purposes one great confederation, bound to a joint
action and working to a common result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
I conclude with what I said at the beginning. To have
the sense of creative activity is not denied to criticism;
but then criticism must be sincere, simple, flexible, ardent,
ever widening its knowledge. Then it may have, in no
contemptible measure, a joyful sense of creative activity,
a sense which a man of insight and conscience will prefer
to that he might derive from a poor, starved, fragmentary,
inadequate creation. And at some epochs no other
creation is possible. Still, in full measure, the sense of
creative activity belongs only to genuine creation; in literature
we must never forget that. But what true man of
letters ever can forget it? It is no such common matter
for a gifted nature to come into possession of a current of
true and living ideas, and to produce amidst the inspiration
of them, that we are likely to underrate it. The
glorious epochs of Ã†schylus and Shakespeare make us
feel their pre-eminence. In an epoch like those is the
true life of literature; there is the promised land towards
which criticism can only beckon.</p>

<h4><i>IV.&mdash;Should We Have an Academy?</i></h4>

<p>It is impossible to put down a book like the history of
the French Academy by Pellisson and D'Olivet without
being led to reflect upon the absence in our own country
of any institution like the French Academy, upon the
probable causes of this absence, and upon its results.
Improvement of the language was the declared grand
aim for the operations of that academy. Its statutes of
foundation say expressly that "the Academy's principal
function shall be to work with all the care and all the
diligence possible at giving sure rules to our language,
and rendering it pure, eloquent and capable of treating
the arts and sciences." It is said that Richelieu had it
in his mind that French should succeed Latin in its general
ascendancy, as Latin had succeeded Greek. If it
were so, even this wish has to some extent been fulfilled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
This was not all Richelieu had in his mind, however.
The new academy was meant to be a literary tribunal, a
high court of letters, and this is what it has really been.</p>

<p>Such an effort, to set up a recognised authority, imposing
on us a high standard in matters of intellect and
taste, has many enemies in human nature. We all of us
like to go our own way, and not to be forced out of the
atmosphere of commonplace habitual to most of us. We
like to be suffered to lie comfortably on the old straw
of our habits, especially of our intellectual habits, even
though this straw may not be very fine and clean. But
if this effort to limit the freedom of our lower nature
finds enemies in human nature, it also finds auxiliaries
in it. Man alone of living creatures, says Cicero, goes
feeling after the discovery of an order, a law of good
taste; other creatures submissively fulfil the law of their
nature.</p>

<p>Now in France, says M. Sainte-Beuve, "the first consideration
for us is not whether we are amused and
pleased by a work of art or of mind, or is it whether we
are touched by it. What we seek above all to learn is
whether we were right in being amused with it, and in
applauding it, and in being moved by it." A Frenchman
has, to a considerable degree, what one may call a conscience
in intellectual matters. Seeing this, we are on
the road to see why the French have their Academy and
we have nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>What are the essential characteristics of the spirit of
our nation? Our greatest admirers would not claim for
us an open and clear mind, a quick and flexible intelligence.
Rather would they allege as our chief spiritual
characteristics energy and honesty&mdash;most important and
fruitful qualities in the intellectual and spiritual, as in
the moral sphere, for, of what we call genius, energy is
the most essential part. Now, what that energy, which
is the life of genius, above everything demands and insists
upon, is freedom&mdash;entire independence of authority,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
prescription and routine, the fullest power to extend as
it will. Therefore, a nation whose chief spiritual characteristic
is energy will not be very apt to set up in
intellectual matters a fixed standard, an authority like an
academy. By this it certainly escapes real inconveniences
and dangers, and it can, at the same time, reach
undeniably splendid heights in poetry and science. We
have Shakespeare, and we have Newton. In the intellectual
sphere there can be no higher names.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some of the requisites of intellectual
work are specially the affair of quickness of mind
and flexibility of intelligence. In prose literature they
are of first-rate importance. These are elements that
can, to a certain degree, be appropriated, while the free
activity of genius cannot. Academies consecrate and
maintain them, and therefore a nation with an eminent
turn for them naturally establishes academies.</p>

<h4><i>V.&mdash;Our Loss Through Provinciality</i></h4>

<p>How much greater is our nation in poetry than prose!
How much better do the productions of its spirit show in
the qualities of genius than in the qualities of intelligence!
But the question as to the utility of academies to the intellectual
life of a nation is not settled when we say that
we have never had an academy, yet we have, confessedly,
a very great literature. It is by no means sure that either
our literature or the general intellectual life of our nation
has got already without academies all that academies can
give. Our literature, in spite of the genius manifested
in it, may fall short in form, method, precision, proportions,
arrangement&mdash;all things where intelligence proper
comes in. It may be weak in prose, full of haphazard,
crudeness, provincialism, eccentricity, violence, blundering;
and instead of always fixing our thoughts upon the
points in which our literature is strong, we should, from
time to time, fix them upon those in which it is weak.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
In France, the Academy serves as a sort of centre and
rallying-point to educated opinion, and gives it a force
which it has not got here. In the bulk of the intellectual
work of a nation which has no centre, no
intellectual metropolis like an academy, there is observable
a note of provinciality. Great powers of mind will
make a man think profoundly, but not even great powers
of mind will keep his taste and style perfectly sound and
sure if he is left too much to himself with no sovereign
organ of opinion near him.</p>

<p>Even men like Jeremy Taylor and Burke suffer here.
Theirs is too often extravagant prose; prose too much
suffered to indulge its caprices; prose at too great a distance
from the centre of good taste; prose with the note
of provinciality; Asiatic prose, somewhat barbarously
rich and overloaded. The note of provinciality in Addison
is to be found in the commonplace of his ideas, though
his style is classical. Where there is no centre like an
academy, if you have genius and powerful ideas, you are
apt not to have the best style going; if you have precision
of style and not genius, you are apt not to have the best
ideas going.</p>

<p>The provincial spirit exaggerates the value of its ideas
for want of a high standard at hand by which to try them;
it is hurried away by fancies; it likes and dislikes too
passionately, too exclusively; its admiration weeps hysterical
tears, and its disapprobation foams at the mouth.
So we get the eruptive and aggressive manner in literature.
Not having the lucidity of a large and centrally-placed
intelligence, the provincial spirit has not its graciousness;
it does not persuade, it makes war; it has not
urbanity, the tone of the city, of the centre, the tone that
always aims at a spiritual and intellectual effect. It loves
hard-hitting rather than persuading. The newspaper,
with its party spirit, its resolute avoidance of shades and
distinctions, is its true literature. In England there
needs a miracle of genius like Shakespeare to produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
balance of mind, and a miracle of intellectual delicacy
like Dr. Newman's to produce urbanity of style.</p>

<p>The reader will ask for some practical conclusion about
the establishment of an academy in this country, and
perhaps I shall hardly give him the one he expects. Nations
have their own modes of acting, and these modes
are not easily changed; they are even consecrated when
great things have been done in them. When a literature
has produced a Shakespeare and a Milton, when it has
even produced a Barrow and a Burke, it cannot well
abandon its traditions; it can hardly begin at this late
time of day with an institution like the French Academy.
An academy quite like the French Academy, a sovereign
organ of the highest literary opinion, a recognised authority
in matters of intellectual tone and taste, we shall
hardly have, and perhaps ought not to wish to have.
But then every one amongst us with any turn for literature
at all will do well to remember to what shortcomings
and excesses, which such an academy tends to correct, we
are liable, and the more liable, of course, for not having
it. He will do well constantly to try himself in respect of
these, steadily to widen his culture, and severely to check
in himself the provincial spirit.</p>

<h4><i>VI.&mdash;Some Illustrative Criticisms</i></h4>

<p>To try and approach Truth on one side after another,
not to strive or cry, not to persist in pressing forward on
any one side with violence and self-will&mdash;it is only thus
that mortals may hope to gain any vision of the mysterious
goddess whom we shall never see except in outline.</p>

<p>The grand power of poetry is the power of dealing
with things so as to awaken in us a wonderfully full,
new and intimate sense of them and of our relation with
them, so that we feel ourselves to be in contact with the
essential nature of those objects, to have their secret,
and be in harmony with them, and this feeling calms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
satisfies us as no other can. Maurice de GuÃ©rin manifested
this magical power of poetry in singular eminence.
His passion for perfection disdained all poetical work that
was not perfectly adequate and felicitous.</p>

<p>His sister EugÃ©nie de GuÃ©rin has the same characteristic
quality&mdash;distinction. Of this quality the world is
impatient; it chafes against it, rails at it, insults it, hates
it, but ends by receiving its influence and by undergoing
its law. This quality at last inexorably corrects the
world's blunders, and fixes the world's ideals.</p>

<p>Heine claimed that he was "a brave soldier in the war
of the liberation of humanity." That was his significance.
He was, if not pre-eminently a brave, yet a
brilliant soldier in the war of liberation of humanity.
He was not an adequate interpreter of the modern world,
but only a brilliant soldier.</p>

<p>Born in 1754, and dying in 1824, Joseph Joubert chose
to hide his life; but he was a man of extraordinary
ardour in the search for truth and of extraordinary fineness
in the perception of it. He was one of those
wonderful lovers of light who, when they have an idea to
put forth, brood long over it first, and wait patiently till
it shines.</p>

<h2 id="ch_31"><a name="GEORGE_BRANDES" id="GEORGE_BRANDES">GEORGE BRANDES</a></h2>

<h3>Main Currents of the Literature of the Nineteenth Century</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>George Brandes was born in Copenhagen on February 4,
1842, and was educated at the University of Copenhagen. The
appearance of his "Ã†sthetic Studies" in 1868 established his
reputation among men of letters of all lands. His criticism received
a philosophic bent from his study of John Stuart Mill,
Comte, and Renan. Complaint is often made of the bias exhibited
by Brandes in his works, which is somewhat of a blemish
on the breadth of his judgment. This bias finds its chief expression
in his anti-clericalism. His publications number thirty-three
volumes, and include works on history, literature, and criticism.
He has written studies of Shakespeare, of Lord Beaconsfield,
of Ibsen, and of Ferdinand Lassalle. His greatest work is
the "Main Currents of the Literature of the Nineteenth Century."
The field covered is so vast that any attempted synopsis
of the volume is impossible here, so in this place we merely
indicate the scope of Brandes's monumental work, and state his
general conclusions.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>The Man and the Book</i></h4>

<p>This remarkable essay in literary criticism is limited
to the first half of the nineteenth century; it concludes
with the historical turning-point of 1848. Within this
period the author discovers, first, a reaction against the
literature of the eighteenth century; and then, the vanquishment
of that reaction. Or, in other words, there is
first a fading away and disappearance of the ideas and
feelings of the preceding century, and then a return of
the ideas of progress in new and higher waves.</p>

<p>"Literary history is, in its profoundest significance,
psychology, the study, the history of the soul"; and
literary criticism is, with our author, nothing less than
the interior history of peoples. Whether we happen to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
agree or to disagree with his personal sympathies, which
lie altogether with liberalism and whether his interpretation
of these complex movements be accepted or rejected
by future criticism, it is at least unquestionable
that his estimate of his science is the right one, and that
his method is the right one, and that no one stands beside
Brandes as an exponent.</p>

<p>The historical movement of the years 1800 to 1848 is
here likened to a drama, of which six different literary
groups represent the six acts. The first three acts incorporate
the reaction against progress and liberty. They
are, first, the French Emigrant Literature, inspired by
Rousseau; secondly, the semi-Catholic Romantic school
of Germany, wherein the reaction has separated itself
more thoroughly from the contemporary struggle for
liberty, and has gained considerably in depth and vigour;
and, thirdly, the militant and triumphant reaction as
shown in Joseph de Maistre, Lamennais, Lamartine and
Victor Hugo, standing out for pope and monarch. The
drama of reaction has here come to its climax; and the
last three acts are to witness its fall, and the revival, in
its place, of the ideas of liberty and of progress.</p>

<p>"It is one man, Byron, who produces the revulsion in
the great drama." And Byron and his English contemporaries,
Wordsworth, Coleridge, Scott, Keats and
Shelley, hold the stage in the fourth act, "Naturalism in
England." The fifth act belongs to the Liberal movement
in France, the "French Romantic School," including
the names of Lamennais, Lamartine and Hugo in
their second phase; and also those of De Musset and
George Sand. The movement passes from France into
"Young Germany," where the sixth act is played by
Heine, Ruge, Feuerbach and others; and the ardent
revolutionary writers of France and of Germany together
prepare for the great political transformation of 1848.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;The Emigrant Literature</i></h4>

<p>At the beginning of our period, France was subjected
to two successive tyrannies: those, namely, of the Convention
and of the Empire, both of which suppressed all
independent thought and literature. Writers were, perforce,
emigrants beyond the frontiers of French power,
and were, one and all, in opposition to the Reign of
Terror, or to the Napoleonic tyranny, or to both; one
and all they were looking forward to the new age which
should come.</p>

<p>There was, therefore, a note of expectancy in this
emigrant literature, which had also the advantage of real
knowledge, gained in long exile, of foreign lands and
peoples. Although it reacts against the dry and narrow
rationalism of the eighteenth century, it is not as yet a
complete reaction against the Liberalism of that period;
the writers of the emigrant group are still ardent in the
cause of Liberty. They are contrary to the spirit of
Voltaire; but they are all profoundly influenced by
Rousseau.</p>

<p>Chateaubriand's romances, "Atala" and "RenÃ©,"
Rousseau's "The New HÃ©loÃ¯se" and Goethe's "Werther"
are the subjects of studies which lead our critic
to a consideration of that new spiritual condition of
which they are the indications. "All the spiritual
maladies," he says, "which make their appearance at this
time may be regarded as the products of two great events&mdash;the
emancipation of the individual and the emancipation
of thought."</p>

<p>Every career now lies open, potentially, to the individual.
His opportunities, and therefore his desires, but
not his powers, have become boundless; and "inordinate
desire is always accompanied by inordinate melancholy."
His release from the old order, which limited his importance,
has set him free for self-idolatry; the old laws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
have broken down, and everything now seems permissible.
He no longer feels himself part of a whole; he
feels himself to be a little world which reflects the great
world. The belief in the saving power of enlightenment
had been rudely shaken, and the minds of men were
confused like an army which receives contradictory
orders in the midst of a battle. SÃ©nancour, Nodier and
Benjamin Constant have left us striking romances picturing
the human spirit in this dilemma; they show also
a new feeling for Nature, new revelations of subjectivity,
and new ideas of womanhood and of passion.</p>

<p>But of the emigrant literature Madame de StaÃ«l is the
chief and central figure. The lawless savagery of the
Revolution did not weaken her fidelity to personal and
political freedom. "She wages war with absolutism
in the state and hypocrisy in society. She teaches her
countrymen to appreciate the characteristics and literature
of the neighbouring nations; she breaks down with
her own hands the wall of self-sufficiency with which
victorious France had surrounded itself. Barante, with
his perspective view of eighteenth-century France, only
continues and completes her work."</p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;The Romantic School in Germany</i></h4>

<p>German Romanticism continues the growing reaction
against the eighteenth century; yet, though it is essentially
reaction, it is not mere reaction, but contains the
seeds of a new development. It is intellectual, poetical,
philosophical and full of real life.</p>

<p>This literary period, marked by the names of HÃ¶lderlin,
A.&nbsp;W. Schlegel, Tieck, Jean Paul Richter,
Schleiermacher, Wackenroder, Novalis, Arnim, Brentano,
resulted in little that has endured. It produced no
typical forms; the character of its literature is musical
rather than plastic; its impulse is not a clear perception
or creation, but an infinite and ineffable aspiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
An intenser spiritual life was at once the impulse and
the goal of the Romanticists, in whom wonder and infinite
desire are born again. A sympathetic interest in the fairy
tale and the legend, in the face of Nature and in her
creatures, in history, institutions and law, and a keener
emotional sensitiveness in poetry, were the result of this
refreshed interior life. In religion, the movement was
towards the richly-coloured mystery and child-like faith
of Catholicism; and in respect of human love it was towards
freedom, spontaneity, intensity, and against the
hard bonds of social conventions.</p>

<p>But its emotions became increasingly morbid, abnormal
and ineffectual. Romanticism tended really, not to
the spiritual emancipation that was its avowed aim, but
to a refinement of sensuality; an indolent and passive
enjoyment is its actual goal; and it repudiates industry
and utility as the philistine barriers which exclude us
from Paradise. Retrogression, the going back to a
fancied Paradise or Golden Age, is the central idea of
Romanticism, and is the secret of the practical ineffectiveness
of the movement.</p>

<p>Friedrich Schlegel's romance, "Lucinde," is a very
typical work of this period. It is based on the Romantic
idea that life and poetry are identical, and its aim is to
counsel the transformation of our actual life into a poem
or work of art. It is a manifesto of self-absorption and
of subjectivity; the reasoned defence of idleness, of enjoyment,
of lawlessness, of the arbitrary expression of the
Self, supreme above all.</p>

<p>The mysticism of Novalis, who preferred sickness to
health, night to day, and invested death itself with sensual
delights, is described by himself as voluptuousness.
It is full of a feverish, morbid desire, which becomes at
last the desire for nothingness. The "blue flower," in
his story "Heinrich von Ofterdingen," is the ideal, personal
happiness, sought for in all Romanticism, but by its
very nature never attainable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;The Reaction in France</i></h4>

<p>Herein we have the culmination of the reactionary
movement. Certain authors are grouped together as
labouring for the re-establishment of the fallen power
of authority; and by the principle of authority is to be
understood "the principle which assumes the life of the
individual and of the nation to be based upon reverence
for inherited tradition." Further, "the principle of
authority in general stood or fell with the authority of
the Church. When that was undermined, it drew all
other authorities with it in its fall."</p>

<p>After a study of the Revolution in its quality as a
religious movement, and the story of the Concordat, our
author traces the genesis of this extreme phase of the
reaction. Its promoters were all of noble birth and bound
by close ties to the old royal families; their aim was
political rather than religious; "they craved for religion
as a panacea for lawlessness." Their ruling idea was the
principle of externality, as opposed to that of inward,
personal feeling and private investigation; it was the
principle of theocracy, as opposed to the sovereignty of
the people; it was the principle of power, as opposed to
the principles of human rights and liberties.</p>

<p>Chateaubriand's famous book, "Le GÃ©nie du Christianisme,"
devoid of real feeling, attempts to vindicate
authority by means of an appeal to sentiment, as if taking
for granted that a reasoned faith was now impossible.
His point of view is romantic, and therefore, religiously,
false; his reasoning is of the "how beautiful!" style.</p>

<p>But the principle was enthroned by Count Joseph de
Maistre, a very different man. The minister of the King
of Sardinia at the court of Russia, he gained the emperor's
confidence by his strong and pure character, his
royalist principles, and his talents. His more important
works, "Du Pape," "De l'Eglise Gallicane," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
"SoirÃ©es de St. PÃ©tersbourg," are the most uncompromising
defence of political and religious autocracy. The
fundamental idea of his works is that "there is no human
society without government, no government without sovereignty,
and no sovereignty without infallibility." Beside
De Maistre stands Bonald, a man of the same views, but
without the other's daring and versatile wit. Chateaubriand's
prose epic "Les Martyrs," the mystically sensual
writings of Madame KrÃ¼dener, and the lyric poetry of
Lamartine and Victor Hugo further popularised the reaction,
which reached its breaking point in Lamennais.</p>

<p>It was at this moment, April, 1824, that the news
came of Byron's death in Greece. The illusion dissolved;
the reaction came to an end. The principle of authority
fell, never to rise again; and the Immanuelistic school
was succeeded by the Satanic.</p>

<h4><i>IV.&mdash;Naturalism in England</i></h4>

<p>The distinguishing character which our author discovers
in the English poets is a love of Nature, of the
country and the sea, of domestic animals and vegetation.
This Naturalism, common to Wordsworth, Coleridge,
Scott, Keats, Moore, Shelley and Byron, becomes, when
transferred to social interests, revolutionary; the English
poet is a Radical. Literary questions interest him not;
he is at heart a politician.</p>

<p>The political background of English intellectual life
at this period is painted forcibly and in the darkest tones.
It was "dark with terror produced in the middle classes
by the excesses of the liberty movement in France, dark
with the tyrannic lusts of proud Tories and the Church's
oppressions, dark with the spilt blood of Irish Catholics
and English artisans." In the midst of all this misery,
Wordsworth and Coleridge recalled the English mind to
the love of real Nature and to the love of liberty.
Wordsworth's conviction was that in town life and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
distractions men had forgotten Nature, and had been
punished for it; constant social intercourse had dissipated
their talents and impaired their susceptibility to simple
and pure impressions. His naturalism is antagonistic
to all official creeds; it is akin to the old Greek conception
of Nature, and is impregnated with pantheism.</p>

<p>The separate studies which follow, dealing with the
natural Romanticism of Coleridge, Southey's Oriental
Romanticism, the Lake school's conception of Liberty,
the Historic Naturalism of Scott, the sensuous poetry of
Keats, the poetry of Irish opposition and revolt, Thomas
Campbell's poetry of freedom, the Republican Humanism
of Landor, Shelley's Radical Naturalism, and like subjects,
are of the highest importance to every English
reader who would understand the time in which he lives.
But Byron's is the heroic figure in this act. "Byron's
genius takes possession of him, and makes him great
and victorious in his argument, directing his aim with
absolute certainty to the vital points." Byron's whole
being burned with the profoundest compassion for the
immeasurable sufferings of humanity. It was liberty
that he worshipped, and he died for liberty.</p>

<h4><i>V.&mdash;The Romantic School in France</i></h4>

<p>During the Revolution the national property had been
divided into twenty times as many hands as before, and
with the fall of Napoleon the industrial period begins.
All restrictions had been removed from industry and
commerce, and capital became the moving power of society
and the object of individual desires. The pursuit
of money helps to give to the literature of the day its
romantic, idealistic stamp. Balzac alone, however, made
money the hero of his epic. Other great writers of the
period, Victor Hugo, Alfred de Musset, George Sand,
Beyle, MÃ©rimÃ©e, ThÃ©ophile Gautier, Sainte-Beuve, kept
as far as possible from the new reality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
The young Romanticists of 1830 burned with a passion
for art and a detestation of drab bourgeoisie. A break
with tradition was demanded in all the arts; the original,
the unconscious, the popular, were what they aimed at.
It was now, as in Hugo's dramas, that the passionate
plebeian appeared on the scene as hero; MÃ©rimÃ©e, as in
"Carmen," painted savage emotions; Nodier's children
spoke like real children; George Sand depicted, in woman,
not conscious virtue and vice, but the innate nobility
and natural goodness of a noble woman's heart. The
poet was no longer looked on as a courtier, but as the
despised high-priest of humanity.</p>

<p>The French Romantic school is the greatest literary
school of the nineteenth century. It displayed three
main tendencies&mdash;the endeavour to reproduce faithfully
some real piece of past history or some phase of modern
life; the endeavour after perfection of form; and enthusiasm
for great religious or social reformatory ideas.
These three tendencies are traced out in the ideals and
work of the brilliant authors of the period; in George
Sand, for instance, who proclaimed that the mission of
art is a mission of sentiment and love; and in Balzac, who
views society as the scientist investigates Nature&mdash;"he
never moralises and condemns; he never allows himself
to be led by disgust or enthusiasm to describe otherwise
than truthfully; nothing is too small, nothing is too great
to be examined and explained."</p>

<p>The impressions which our author gives of Sainte-Beuve,
Gautier, George Sand, Balzac and MÃ©rimÃ©e are
vivid and concrete; they are high achievements in literary
portraiture, set in a real historic background.</p>

<h4><i>VI.&mdash;Young Germany</i></h4>

<p>The personality, writings, and actions of Byron had
an extraordinary influence upon "Young Germany," a
movement initiated by Heine and BÃ¶rne, and characterised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
by a strong craving for liberty. "Byron, with his
contempt for the real negation of liberty that lay concealed
beneath the 'wars of liberty' against Napoleon,
with his championship of the oppressed, his revolt against
social custom, his sensuality and spleen, his passionate
love of liberty in every domain, seemed to the men of
that day to be an embodiment of all that they understood
by the modern spirit, modern poetry."</p>

<p>The literary group known as Young Germany has no
creative minds of the highest, and only one of very high
rank, namely, Heine. "It denied, it emancipated, it
cleared up, it let in fresh air. It is strong through its
doubt, its hatred of thraldom, its individualism." The
Germany of those days has been succeeded by a quite
new Germany, organised to build up and to put forth
material strength, and the writers of the first half of the
nineteenth century, who were always praising France and
condemning the sluggishness of their own country, are
but little read.</p>

<p>The literary figures of this period who are painted by
our author, are BÃ¶rne, Heine, Immermann, Menzel,
Gutzkow, Laube, Mundt, Rahel Varnhagen von Ense,
Bettina von Arnim, Charlotte Stieglitz, and many others,
to whose writings, in conjunction with those of the
French Romanticists, Brandes ascribes the general revolt
of the oppressed peoples of Europe in 1848. Of the men
of that date he says: "They had a faith that could remove
mountains, and a hope that could shake the earth.
Liberty, parliament, national unity, liberty of the Press,
republic, were to them magic words, at the very sound
of which their hearts leaped like the heart of a youth
who suddenly sees his beloved."</p>

<h2 id="ch_41"><a name="ROBERT_BURTON" id="ROBERT_BURTON">ROBERT BURTON</a></h2>

<h3>The Anatomy of Melancholy</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Robert Burton was born on February 8, 1576, of an old family,
at Lindley, Leicestershire, England; was educated at the free
school of Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire, and at Brasenose College,
Oxford, and in 1599 was elected student of Christ Church.
In 1616 he was presented with the vicarage of St. Thomas, Oxford,
and in 1636 with the rectory of Segrave, in Leicestershire,
and kept both these livings until his death. But he lived chiefly
in his rooms at Christ Church, Oxford, where, burrowing in the
treasures of the Bodleian Library, he elaborated his learned and
whimsical book. He died on January 25, 1639, and was buried
in Christ Church Cathedral. The "Anatomy of Melancholy" is
an enormous compendium of sound sense, sly humour, universal
erudition, mediÃ¦val science, fantastic conceits, and noble sentiments,
arranged in the form of a most methodical treatise,
divided, and subdivided again, into sections dealing with every
conceivable aspect of this fell disorder. It is an intricate tissue
of quotations and allusions, and its interest lies as much in its
texture as in its argument. The "Anatomy" consists of an introduction,
"Democritus Junior to the Reader," and then of
three "Partitions," of which the first treats of the Causes of
Melancholy, the second of its Cure, and the third of Love-Melancholy,
wherewith is included the Melancholy of Superstition.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;Democritus Junior to the Reader</i></h4>

<p>Gentle reader, I presume thou wilt be very inquisitive
to know what antic or personate actor this is that
so insolently intrudes upon this common theatre to the
world's view, arrogating another man's name; whence
he is, why he doth it, and what he hath to say. Seek
not after that which is hid; if the contents please thee,
suppose the man in the moon, or whom thou wilt, to be
the author; I would not willingly be known.</p>

<p>I have masked myself under this visard because, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Democritus, I have lived a silent, sedentary, solitary,
private life in the university, penned up most part in my
study. Though by my profession a divine, yet, out of
a running wit, an unconstant, unsettled mind, I had a
great desire to have some smattering in all subjects;
which Plato commends as fit to be imprinted in all
curious wits, not to be a slave of one science, as most
do, but to rove abroad, to have an oar in every man's
boat, to taste of every dish, and to sip of every cup;
which, saith Montaigne, was well performed by Aristotle.</p>

<p>I have little, I want nothing; all my treasure is in
Minerva's tower. Though I lead a monastic life, myself
my own theatre, I hear and see what is done abroad,
how others run, ride, turmoil, in court and country.
Amid the gallantry and misery of the world, jollity,
pride, perplexities and cares, simplicity and villainy,
subtlety, knavery, candour, and integrity, I rub on in
private, left to a solitary life and mine own domestic
discontents.</p>

<p>So I call myself Democritus, to assume a little more
liberty of speech, or, if you will needs know, for that
reason which Hippocrates relates, how, coming to visit
him one day, he found Democritus in his garden at Abdera,
under a shady bower, with a book on his knees,
busy at his study, sometimes writing, sometimes walking.
The subject of his book was melancholy and madness.
About him lay the carcasses of many several
beasts, newly by him cut up and anatomised; not that
he did contemn God's creatures, but to find out the seat
of this black bile, or melancholy, and how it is engendered
in men's bodies, to the intent he might better cure
it in himself, and by his writings teach others how to
avoid it; which good intent of his Democritus Junior is
bold to imitate, and because he left it imperfect and it is
now lost, to revive again, prosecute, and finish in this
treatise. I seek not applause; I fear good men's censures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
and to their favourable acceptance I submit my
labours. But as the barking of a dog I contemn those
malicious and scurrile obloquies, flouts, calumnies of
railers and detractors.</p>

<p>Of the necessity of what I have said, if any man doubt
of it, I shall desire him to make a brief survey of the
world, as Cyprian adviseth Donate; supposing himself
to be transported to the top of some high mountain, and
thence to behold the tumults and chances of this wavering
world, he cannot choose but either laugh at, or pity
it. St. Hierom, out of a strong imagination, being in
the wilderness, conceived that he saw them dancing in
Rome; and if thou shalt climb to see, thou shalt soon
perceive that all the world is mad, that it is melancholy,
dotes; that it is a common prison of gulls, cheats, flatterers,
etc., and needs to be reformed. Kingdoms and
provinces are melancholy; cities and families, all
creatures vegetal, sensible and rational, all sorts, sects,
ages, conditions, are out of tune; from the highest to
the lowest have need of physic. Who is not brain-sick?
Oh, giddy-headed age! Mad endeavours! Mad actions!</p>

<p>If Democritus were alive now, and should but see the
superstition of our age, our religious madness, so many
professed Christians, yet so few imitators of Christ, so
much talk and so little conscience, so many preachers
and such little practice, such variety of sects&mdash;how dost
thou think he might have been affected? What would
he have said to see, hear, and read so many bloody battles,
such streams of blood able to turn mills, to make
sport for princes, without any just cause? Men well
proportioned, carefully brought up, able in body and
mind, led like so many beasts to the slaughter in the
flower of their years, without remorse and pity, killed
for devils' food, 40,000 at once! At once? That were
tolerable; but these wars last always; and for many ages,
nothing so familiar as this hacking and hewing, massacres,
murders, desolations! Who made creatures, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
peaceable, born to love, mercy, meekness, so to rave
like beasts and run to their own destruction?</p>

<p>How would our Democritus have been affected to see
so many lawyers, advocates, so many tribunals, so little
justice; so many laws, yet never more disorders; the
tribunal a labyrinth; to see a lamb executed, a wolf pronounce
sentence? What's the market but a place wherein
they cozen one another, a trap? Nay, what's the
world itself but a vast chaos, a theatre of hypocrisy, a
shop of knavery, a scene of babbling, the academy of
vice? A warfare, in which you must kill or be killed,
wherein every man is for himself; no charity, love,
friendship, fear of God, alliance, affinity, consanguinity,
can contain them. Our goddess is Queen Money, to
whom we daily offer sacrifice. It's not worth, virtue,
wisdom, valour, learning, honesty, religion, for which
we are respected, but money, greatness, office, honour.
All these things are easy to be discerned, but how would
Democritus have been moved had he seen the secrets
of our hearts! All the world is mad, and every member
of it, and I can but wish myself and them a good physician,
and all of us a better mind.</p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;The Causes of Melancholy</i></h4>

<p>The impulsive cause of these miseries in man was the
sin of our first parent, Adam; and this, belike, is that
which our poets have shadowed unto us in the tale of
Pandora's Box, which, being opened through her curiosity,
filled the world full of all manner of diseases. But
as our sins are the principal cause, so the instrumental
causes of our infirmities are as diverse as the infirmities
themselves. Stars, heavens, elements, and all those
creatures which God hath made, are armed against sinners.
But the greatest enemy to man is man, his own
executioner, a wolf, a devil to himself and others. Again,
no man amongst us so sound that hath not some impediment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
of body or mind. There are diseases acute
and chronic, first and secondary, lethal, salutary, errant,
fixed, simple, compound, etc. Melancholy is the most
eminent of the diseases of the phantasy or imagination;
and dotage, phrensy, madness, hydrophobia, lycanthropy,
St. Vitus' dance, and ecstasy are forms of it.</p>

<p>Melancholy is either in disposition or habit. In disposition
it is that transitory melancholy which comes
and goes upon every small occasion of sorrow; we call
him melancholy that is dull, sad, sour, lumpish, ill-disposed,
and solitary; and from these dispositions no man
living is free; none so wise, patient, happy, generous, or
godly, that can vindicate himself.</p>

<p>Melancholy is a cold and dry, thick, black, and sour
humour, purged from the spleen; it is a bridle to the
other two hot humours, blood and choler, preserving
them in the blood and nourishing the bones. Such as
have the Moon, Saturn, Mercury, misaffected in their
genitures; such as live in over-cold or over-hot climates;
such as are solitary by nature; great students, given to
much contemplation; such as lead a life out of action;
all are most subject to melancholy.</p>

<p>Six things are much spoken of amongst physicians as
principal causes of this disease; if a man be melancholy,
he hath offended in one of the six. They are diet, air,
exercise, sleeping, and walking, and perturbations of the
mind.</p>

<p>Idleness, the badge of gentry, or want of exercise,
the bane of body and mind, the nurse of naughtiness,
the chief author of all mischief, one of the seven deadly
sins, and a sole cause of this and many other maladies,
the devil's cushion and chief reposal, begets melancholy
sooner than anything else. Such as live at ease, and
have no ordinary employment to busy themselves about,
cannot compose themselves to do aught; they cannot
abide work, though it be necessary, easy, as to dress
themselves, write a letter, or the like. He or she that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
is idle, be they never so rich, fortunate, happy, let them
have all that heart can desire, they shall never be pleased,
never well in body and mind, but weary still, sickly still,
vexed still, loathing still, weeping, sighing, grieving,
suspecting, offended with the world, with every object,
wishing themselves gone or dead, or else carried away
with some foolish phantasy or other.</p>

<p>Others, giving way to the passions and perturbations
of fear, grief, shame, revenge, hatred, malice, etc., are
torn in pieces, as ActÃ¦on was with his dogs, and crucify
their own souls. Every society and private family is
full of envy; it takes hold of all sorts of men, from prince
to ploughman; scarce three in a company, but there is
siding, faction, emulation, between two of them, some
jar, private grudge, heart-burning in the midst. Scarce
two great scholars in an age, but with bitter invectives
they fall foul one on the other. Being that we are so
peevish and perverse, insolent and proud, so factious
and seditious, malicious and envious, we do maul and
vex one another, torture, disquiet, and precipitate ourselves
into that gulf of woes and cares, aggravate our
misery and melancholy, and heap upon us hell and eternal
damnation.</p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;The Cure of Melancholy</i></h4>

<p>"It matters not," saith Paracelsus, "whether it be God
or the devil, angels or unclean spirits, cure him, so that
he be eased." Some have recourse to witches; but much
better were it for patients that are troubled with melancholy
to endure a little misery in this life than to hazard
their souls' health for ever. All unlawful cures are to
be refused, and it remains to treat of those that are admitted.</p>

<p>These are such as God hath appointed, by virtue of
stones, herbs, plants, meats, and the like, which are prepared
and applied to our use by the art and industry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
physicians, God's intermediate ministers. We must begin
with prayer and then use physic; not one without
the other, but both together.</p>

<p>Diet must be rectified in substance and in quantity;
air rectified; for there is much in choice of place and of
chamber, in opportune opening and shutting of windows,
and in walking abroad at convenient times. Exercise
must be rectified of body and mind. Hawking,
hunting, fishing are good, especially the last, which is
still and quiet, and if so be the angler catch no fish, yet
he hath a wholesome walk and pleasant shade by the
sweet silver streams. But the most pleasant of all pastimes
is to make a merry journey now and then with
some good companions, to visit friends, see cities, castles,
towns, to walk amongst orchards, gardens, bowers,
to disport in some pleasant plain. St. Bernard, in the
description of his monastery, is almost ravished with the
pleasures of it. "Good God," saith he, "what a company
of pleasures hast Thou made for man!" But what
is so fit and proper to expel idleness and melancholy as
study? What so full of content as to read, and see maps,
pictures, statues, jewels, and marbles, so exquisite to be
beheld that, as Chrysostom thinketh, "if any man be
sickly or troubled in mind, and shall but stand over
against one of Phidias's images, he will forget all care
in an instant?"</p>

<p>If thou receivest wrong, compose thyself with patience
to bear it. Thou shalt find greatest ease to be quiet. I
say the same of scoffs, slanders, detractions, which tend
to our disgrace; 'tis but opinion; if we would neglect
or contemn them, they would reflect disgrace on them
that offered them. "Yea, but I am ashamed, disgraced,
degraded, exploded; my notorious crimes and villainies
are come to light!" Be content; 'tis but a nine days'
wonder; 'tis heavy, ghastly, fearful news at first, but
thine offence will be forgotten in an instant. Thou art
not the first offender, nor shalt thou be the last. If he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
alone should accuse thee that were faultless, how many
executioners, how many accusers, would thou have?
Shall every man have his desert, thou wouldst peradventure
be a saint in comparison. Be not dismayed; it
is human to err. Be penitent, ask forgiveness, and vex
thyself no more. Doth the moon care for the barking
of a dog?</p>

<h4><i>IV.&mdash;Love-Melancholy</i></h4>

<p>There will not be wanting those who will much discommend
this treatise of love-melancholy, and object
that it is too light for a divine, too phantastical, and fit
only for a wanton poet. So that they may be admired
for grave philosophers, and staid carriage, they cannot
abide to hear talk of love-toys; in all their outward actions
they are averse; and yet, in their cogitations, they
are all but as bad, if not worse than others. I am almost
afraid to relate the passions which this tyrant love
causeth among men; it hath wrought such stupendous
and prodigious effects, such foul offences.</p>

<p>As there be divers causes of this heroical love, so
there be many good remedies, among which good counsel
and persuasion are of great moment, especially if it
proceed from a wise, fatherly, discreet person. They
will lament and howl for a while; but let him proceed,
by foreshewing the miserable dangers that will surely
happen, the pains of hell, joys of paradise, and the like;
and this is a very good means, for love is learned of
itself, but hardly left without a tutor.</p>

<p>In sober sadness, marriage is a bondage, a thraldom,
a hindrance to all good enterprises; "he hath married
a wife, and therefore cannot come"; a rock on which
many are saved, many are cast away. Not that the
thing is evil in itself, or troublesome, but full of happiness,
and a thing which pleases God; but to indiscreet,
sensual persons, it is a feral plague, many times an hell
itself. If thy wife be froward, all is in an uproar; if wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
and learned, she will be insolent and peevish; if poor,
she brings beggary; if young, she is wanton and untaught.
Say the best, she is a commanding servant;
thou hadst better have taken a good housewifely maid
in her smock. Since, then, there is such hazard, keep
thyself as thou art; 'tis good to match, much better to
be free. Consider withal how free, how happy, how secure,
how heavenly, in respect, a single man is.</p>

<p>But when all is said, since some be good, some bad,
let's put it to the venture. Marry while thou mayest,
and take thy fortune as it falls. Be not so covetous, so
distrustful, so curious and nice, but let's all marry; to-morrow
is St. Valentine's Day. Since, then, marriage
is the last and best cure of heroical love, all doubts are
cured and impediments removed; God send us all good
wives!</p>

<p>Take this for a corollory and conclusion; as thou tenderest
thine own welfare in love-melancholy, in the melancholy
of religion, and in all other melancholy; observe
this short precept&mdash;Be not solitary; be not idle.</p>

<h3>On Heroes and Hero-Worship</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>This is the last of four series of lectures which Carlyle (see
Vol. IX, p. 99) delivered in London in successive years, and is the
only series which was published. The "Lectures on Heroes"
were given in May, 1840, and were published, with emendations
and additions, from the reporter's notes in 1841. The preceding
series were on "German Literature," 1837; "The Successive
Periods of European Culture," 1838; and "The Revolutions of
Modern Europe," 1839. Carlyle's profound and impassioned belief
in the quasi-divine inspiration of great men, in the authoritative
nature of their "message," and in their historical effectiveness,
was a reaction against a way of writing history which finds
the origin of events in "movements," "currents," and "tendencies"
neglecting or minimising the power of personality.
For Carlyle, biography was the essential element in history; his
view of events was the dramatic view, as opposed to the scientific
view. It is idle to inquire which is the better or truer
view, where both are necessary. But Carlyle is here specially
tilting against a prejudice which has so utterly passed away
that it is difficult even to imagine it. This was to the effect
that eminent historical figures have been in some sense impostors.
This work suffers a good deal from its origin, but,
like others of Carlyle's writings, it has had great effect in discrediting
a barren and flippant rationalism.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;The Hero as Divinity</i></h4>

<p>We have undertaken to discourse on great men, their
manner of appearance in our world's business, how they
shaped themselves in the world's history, what ideas
men formed of them, and what work they did. We are
to treat of hero-worship and the heroic in human affairs.
The topic is as wide as universal history itself,
for the history of what man has accomplished in this
world is, at bottom, the history of the great men who
have worked here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
It is well said that a man's religion is the chief fact
with regard to him. I do not mean the Church creed
which he professes, but the thing that he does practically
believe, the manner in which he feels himself to
be spiritually related to the unseen world. Was it
heathenism, a plurality of gods, a mere sensuous representation
of the mystery of life, and for chief recognised
element therein physical force? Was it Christianism;
faith in an Invisible as the only reality; time ever resting
on eternity; pagan empire of force displaced by the
nobler supremacy of holiness? Was it scepticism, uncertainty,
and inquiry whether there was an unseen
world at all, or perhaps unbelief and flat denial? The
answer to these questions gives us the soul of the history
of the man or nation.</p>

<p>Odin, the central figure of Scandinavian paganism,
shall be our emblem of the hero as divinity. And in the
first place I protest against the theory that this paganism
or any other religion has consisted of mere quackery,
priestcraft, and dupery. Quackery gives birth to
nothing; gives death to all. Man everywhere is the born
enemy of lies, and paganism, to its followers, was at one
time earnestly true. Nor can we admit that other theory,
which attributed these mythologies to allegory, or
to the play of poetic minds. Pagan religion, like every
other, is indeed a symbol of what men felt about the
universe, but a practical guiding knowledge of this mysterious
life of theirs, and not a perfect poetic symbol of
it, has been the want of men. The "Pilgrim's Progress"
is a just and beautiful allegory, but it could never
have preceded the faith which it symbolises. Men never
risked their soul's life on allegories; there was a kind of
fact at the heart of paganism.</p>

<p>To the primitive pagan thinker, who was simple as a
child, yet had a man's depth and strength, nature had
as yet no name. It stood naked, flashing in on him,
beautiful, awful, unspeakable; nature was preternatural.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
The world, which is now divine only to the gifted, was
then divine to whosoever would turn his eye upon it.
Still more was the body of man, and the mystery of his
consciousness, an emblem to them of God, and truly
worshipful.</p>

<p>How much more, then, was the worship of a hero
reasonable&mdash;the transcendent admiration of a great man!
For great men are still admirable. At bottom there is
nothing else admirable. Admiration for one higher
than himself is to this hour the vivifying influence in
man's life, and is the germ of Christianity itself. The
greatest of all heroes is One whom we do not name
here.</p>

<p>Without doubt there was a first teacher and captain
of these northern peoples, an Odin palpable to the sense,
a real hero of flesh and blood. Tradition calls him inventor
of the Runes, or Scandinavian alphabet, and
again of poetry. To the wild Norse souls this noble-hearted
man was hero, prophet, god. That the man
Odin, speaking with a hero's voice and heart, as with
an impressiveness out of Heaven, told his people the
infinite importance of valour, how man thereby became
a god; and that his people believed this message of his,
and thought it a message out of Heaven, and believed
him a divinity for telling it to them&mdash;this seems to me
the primary seed-grain of the Norse religion. For
that religion was a sternly impressive consecration of
valour.</p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;The Hero as Prophet</i></h4>

<p>We turn now to Mohammedanism among the Arabs
for the second phase of hero-worship, wherein the hero
is not now regarded as a god, but as one God-inspired,
a prophet. Mohammed is not the most eminent
prophet, but is the one of whom we are freest to speak.
Nor is he the truest of prophets but I do esteem him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
true one. Let us try to understand what he meant with
the world; what the world meant and means with him
will then be more answerable.</p>

<p>Certainly he was no scheming impostor, no falsehood
incarnate; theories of that kind are the product of an
age of scepticism, and indicate the saddest spiritual
paralysis. A false man found a religion? Why, a false
man cannot build a brick house! No Mirabeau, Napoleon,
Burns, Cromwell, no man adequate to do anything,
but is first of all in right earnest about it. Sincerity
is the great characteristic of all men in any way
heroic.</p>

<p>The Arabs are a notable people; their country itself is
notable. Consider that wide, waste horizon of sand,
empty, silent like a sea; you are all alone there, left
alone with the universe; by day a fierce sun blazing
down with intolerable radiance; by night the great deep
heaven, with its stars&mdash;a fit country for a swift-handed,
deep-hearted race of men. The Arab character is agile,
active, yet most meditative, enthusiastic. Hospitable,
taciturn, earnest, truthful, deeply religious, the Arabs
were a people of great qualities, waiting for the day
when they should become notable to all the world.</p>

<p>Here, in the year 570 of our era, the man Mohammed
was born, and grew up in the bosom of the wilderness,
alone with Nature and his own thoughts. From an early
age he had been remarked as a thoughtful man, and his
companions named him "The Faithful." He was forty
before he talked of any mission from Heaven. All this
time living a peaceful life, he was looking through the
shows of things into things themselves.</p>

<p>Then, having withdrawn to a cavern near Mecca for
a month of prayer and meditation, he told his wife
Kadijah that, by the unspeakable favour of Heaven, he
was in doubt and darkness no longer, but saw it all.
That all these idols and formulas were nothing; that
there was one God in and over all; that God is great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
and is the reality. <i xml:lang="ar" lang="ar">Allah akbar</i>, "God is great"; and
then <i xml:lang="ar" lang="ar">Islam</i>, "we must submit to Him."</p>

<p>This is yet the only true morality known. A man is
right and invincible, while he joins himself to the great
deep law of the world, in spite of all superficial laws,
temporary appearances, profit-and-loss calculations.
This is the soul of Islam, and is properly also the soul
of Christianity. We are to receive whatever befalls us
as sent from God above. Islam means in its way the
denial of self, annihilation of self. This is yet the highest
wisdom that Heaven has revealed to our earth. In
Mohammed, and in his Koran, I find first of all sincerity,
the total freedom from cant. For these twelve
centuries his religion has been the guidance of a fifth
part of mankind, and, above all, it has been a religion
heartily believed.</p>

<p>The Arab nation was a poor shepherd people; a hero-prophet
was sent down to them; within one century afterwards
Arabia is at Grenada on this hand, at Delhi on
that!</p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;The Hero as Poet</i></h4>

<p>The hero as divinity and as prophet are productions
of old ages, not to be repeated in the new. We are now
to see our hero in the less ambitious, but also less questionable,
character of poet. For the hero can be poet,
prophet, king, priest, or what you will, according to the
kind of world he finds himself born into. I have no notion
of a truly great man that could not be all sorts of
men.</p>

<p>Indeed, the poet and prophet, participators in the open
secret of the universe, are one; though the prophet has
seized the sacred mystery rather on its moral side, and
the poet on the Ã¦sthetic side. Poetry is essentially a
song; its thoughts are musical not in word only, but in
heart and in substance.</p>

<p>Shakespeare and Dante are our two canonised poets;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
they dwell apart, none equal, none second to them.
Dante's book was written, in banishment, with his
heart's blood. His great soul, homeless on earth, made
its home more and more in that awful other world. The
three kingdoms&mdash;<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Inferno</i>, <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Purgatorio</i>, <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Paradiso</i>&mdash;are like
compartments of a great supernatural world-cathedral,
piled up there, stern, solemn, awful; Dante's world of
souls. It is the sincerest of all poems. Sincerity here,
too, we find to be the measure of worth. Intensity is
the prevailing character of his genius; his greatness lies
in fiery emphasis and depth; it is seen even in the
graphic vividness of his painting. Dante burns as a pure
star, fixed in the firmament, at which the great and high
of all ages kindle themselves.</p>

<p>As Dante embodies musically the inner life of the Middle
Ages, so Shakespeare embodies for us its outer life,
its chivalries, courtesies, humours, ambitions. Dante
gave us the soul of Europe; Shakespeare gave us its
body. Of this Shakespeare of ours, the best judgment
of Europe is slowly pointing to the conclusion that he
is the chief of all poets, the greatest intellect who has
left record of himself in the way of literature.</p>

<p>It is in portrait-painting, the delineation of men, that
the greatness of Shakespeare comes out most decisively.
His calm, creative perspicacity is unexampled. The
word that will describe the thing follows of itself from
such clear intense sight of the thing. He takes in all
kinds of men&mdash;a Falstaff, Othello, Juliet, Coriolanus;
sets them all forth to us in their rounded completeness,
loving, just, the equal brother of all.</p>

<p>The degree of vision that dwells in a man is a correct
measure of the man, and Shakespeare's is the greatest
of intellects. Novalis beautifully remarks of him that
those dramas of his are products of nature, too, deep as
nature herself. Shakespeare's art is not artifice; the
noblest worth of it is not there by plan or pre-contrivance.
The latest generations of men will find new meanings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
in Shakespeare, new elucidations of their own human
being.</p>

<p>Shakespeare, too, was a prophet, in his way, of an
insight analogous to the prophetic, though he took it
up in another strain. Nature seemed to this man also
divine, unspeakable, deep as Tophet, high as heaven.
"We are such stuff as dreams are made of." There
rises a kind of universal psalm out of Shakespeare, not
unfit to make itself heard among the still more sacred
psalms.</p>

<p>England, before long, this island of ours, will hold
but a small fraction of the English; east and west to the
antipodes there will be a Saxondom covering great
spaces of the globe. What is it that can keep all these
together into virtually one nation, so that they do not
fall out and fight, but live at peace? Here, I say, is an
English king whom no time or chance can dethrone!
King Shakespeare shines over us all, as the noblest,
gentlest, yet strongest of rallying-signs; we can fancy
him as radiant aloft over all the nations of Englishmen,
a thousand years hence. Truly it is a great thing for
a nation that it gets an articulate voice.</p>

<h4><i>IV.&mdash;The Hero as Priest</i></h4>

<p>The priest, too, is a kind of prophet. In him, also,
there is required to be a light of inspiration. He presides
over the worship of the people, and is the uniter
of them with the unseen Holy. He is their spiritual
captain, as the prophet is their spiritual king with many
captains.</p>

<p>Luther and Knox were by express vocation priests,
yet it will suit us better here to consider them chiefly
in their historical character as reformers. The battling
reformer is from time to time a needful and inevitable
phenomenon. Obstructions are never wanting; the very
things that were once indispensable furtherances become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
obstructions, and need to be shaken off and left behind
us&mdash;a business often of enormous difficulty.</p>

<p>We are to consider Luther as an idol-breaker, a
bringer back of men to reality, for that is the function
of great men and teachers. Thus it was that Luther
said to the Pope, "This thing of yours that you call a
pardon of sins, is a bit of rag-paper with ink. It, and
so much like it, is nothing else. God alone can pardon
sins. God's Church is not a semblance, Heaven and
Hell are not semblances. Standing on this, I, a poor
German monk, am stronger than you all."</p>

<p>The most interesting phase which the Reformation
anywhere assumes is that of Puritanism, which even got
itself established as a Presbyterianism and National
Church among the Scotch, and has produced in the
world very notable fruit. Knox was the chief priest and
founder of that faith which became the faith of Scotland,
of New England, of Oliver Cromwell; and that which
Knox did for his nation we may really call a resurrection
as from death. The people began to live. Scotch
literature and thought, Scotch industry, James Watt,
David Hume, Walter Scott, Robert Burns&mdash;I find Knox
and the Reformation acting in the heart's core of every
one of these persons and phenomena; I find that without
the Reformation they would not have been.</p>

<p>Knox could not live but by fact. He is an instance
to us how a man, by sincerity itself, becomes heroic.
We find in Knox a good, honest, intellectual talent, no
transcendent one; he was a narrow, inconsiderable man
as compared with Luther; but in heartfelt, instinctive
adherence to truth, in real sincerity, he has no superior.
His heart is of the true prophet cast. "He lies there,"
said the Earl of Morton, at his grave, "who never
feared the face of man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<h4><i>V.&mdash;The Hero as Man of Letters</i></h4>

<p>The hero as man of letters is a new and singular
phenomenon. Living in his squalid garret and rusty
coat; ruling from his grave after death whole nations
and generations; he must be regarded as our most important
modern person. Such as he may be, he is the
soul of all. Intrinsically it is the same function which
the old generations named a prophet, priest, or divinity
for doing.</p>

<p>The three great prophets of the eighteenth century,
that singular age of scepticism, were Johnson, Rousseau,
and Burns; they were not, indeed, heroic bringers
of the light, but heroic seekers of it, struggling under
mountains of impediment.</p>

<p>As for Johnson, I have always considered him to be,
by nature, one of our great English souls. It was in
virtue of his sincerity, of his speaking still in some sort
from the heart of nature, though in the current artificial
dialect, that Johnson was a prophet. The highest gospel
he preached was a kind of moral prudence, coupled
with this other great gospel, "Clear your mind of
cant!" These two things, joined together, were, perhaps,
the greatest gospel that was possible at that time.</p>

<p>Of Rousseau and his heroism I cannot say so much.
He was not a strong man; but a morbid, excitable, spasmodic
man; at best, intense rather than strong. Yet, at
least he was heartily in earnest, if ever man was; his
ideas possessed him like demons.</p>

<p>The fault and misery of Rousseau was egoism, which
is the source and summary of all faults and miseries
whatsoever. He had not perfected himself into victory
over mere desire; a mean hunger was still his motive
principle. He was a very vain man, hungry for the
praises of men. The whole nature of the man was poisoned;
there was nothing but suspicion, self-isolation,
and fierce, moody ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
And yet this Rousseau, with his celebrations of nature,
even of savage life in nature, did once more touch upon
reality and struggle towards reality. Strangely through
all that defacement, degradation, and almost madness,
there is in the inmost heart of poor Rousseau a spark
of real heavenly fire. Out of all that withered, mocking
philosophism, scepticism, and persiflage of his day there
has arisen in this man the ineradicable feeling and knowledge
that this life of ours is true, not a theorem, but a
fact.</p>

<p>The French Revolution found its evangelist in Rousseau.
His semi-delirious speculations on the miseries
of civilised life, and such like, helped to produce a delirium
in France generally. It is difficult to say what
the governors of the world could do with such a man.
What he could do with them is clear enough&mdash;guillotine
a great many of them.</p>

<p>The tragedy of Burns's life is known to all. The largest
soul of all the British lands appeared under every
disadvantage; uninstructed, poor, born only to hard
manual toil; and writing, when it came to that, in a
rustic special dialect, known only to a small province of
the country he lived in.</p>

<p>We find in Burns a noble, rough genuineness, the
true simplicity of strength, and a deep and earnest element
of sunshine and joyfulness; yet the chief quality,
both of his poetry and of his life, is sincerity&mdash;a wild
wrestling with the truth of things.</p>

<h4><i>VI.&mdash;The Hero as King</i></h4>

<p>The commander over men, to whose will our wills are
to be subordinated and loyally surrender themselves,
and find their welfare in doing so, may be reckoned the
most important of great men. He is called <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Rex</i>, "Regulator";
our own name is still better&mdash;king, which
means "can-ning," "able-man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
In rebellious ages, when kingship itself seems dead
and abolished, Cromwell and Napoleon step forth again
as kings. The old ages are brought back to us; the
manner in which kings were made, and kingship itself
first took rise, is again exhibited in the history of these
two.</p>

<p>The war of the Puritans was a section of that universal
war which alone makes up the true history of the
world&mdash;the war of Belief against Unbelief; the struggle
of men intent on the real essence of things, against men
intent on the semblances and forms of things. And
among these Puritans Cromwell stood supreme, grappling
like a giant, face to face, heart to heart, with the
naked truth of things. Yet Cromwell alone finds no
hearty apologist anywhere. Selfish ambition, dishonesty,
duplicity; a fierce, coarse, hypocritical Tartuffe;
turning all that noble struggle for constitutional liberty
into a sorry farce played for his own benefit. This, and
worse, is the character they give him.</p>

<p>From of old, this theory of Cromwell's falsity has been
incredible to me. All that we know of him betokens an
earnest, hearty sincerity. Everywhere we have to note
his decisive, practical eye, how he drives towards the
practicable, and has a genuine insight into what is fact.
Such an intellect does not belong to a false man; the
false man sees false shows, plausibilities, expediences;
the true man is needed to discern even practical truth.</p>

<p>Napoleon by no means seems to me so great a man
as Cromwell. His enormous victories which reached
over all Europe, while Cromwell abode mainly in our
little England, are but as the high stilts on which the
man is seen standing; the stature of the man is not altered
thereby. I find in him no such sincerity as in
Cromwell; only a far inferior sort.</p>

<p>"False as a bulletin," became a proverb in Napoleon's
time. Yet he had a sincerity, a certain instinctive, ineradicable
feeling for reality; and did base himself upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
fact, so long as he had any basis. He had an instinct
of Nature better than his culture was. His companions,
we are told, were one evening busily occupied arguing
that there could be no God; they had proved it by all
manner of logic. Napoleon, looking up into the stars,
answers, "Very ingenious, Messieurs; but who made
all that?" The atheistic logic runs off from him like
water; the great fact stares him in the face. So, too, in
practice; he, as every man that can be great, sees,
through all entanglements, the practical heart of the
matter, and drives straight towards that.</p>

<p>Accordingly, there was a faith in him, genuine so far
as it went. That this new, enormous democracy is an
insuppressible fact, which the whole world cannot put
down&mdash;this was a true insight of his, and took his conscience
and enthusiasm along with it. And did he not
interpret the dim purport of it well? <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La carriÃ¨re ouverte
aux talents</i>&mdash;"the implements to him who can handle
them"&mdash;this actually is the truth, and even the whole
truth; it includes whatever the French Revolution or
any revolution could mean. It is a great, true message
from our last great man.</p>

<h3><i>I.&mdash;The Philosophy of Clothes</i></h3>

<p>Considering our present advanced state of culture,
and how the torch of science has now been brandished
and borne about, with more or less effect, for five thousand
years and upwards, it is surprising that hitherto
little or nothing of a fundamental character, whether in
the way of philosophy or history, has been written on
the subject of clothes. Every other tissue has been dissected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
but the vestural tissue of woollen or other cloth,
which man's soul wears as its outmost wrappage, has
been quite overlooked. All speculation has tacitly figured
man as a clothed animal, whereas he is by nature
a naked animal, and only in certain circumstances, by
purpose and device, masks himself in clothes.</p>

<p>But here, as in so many other cases, learned, indefatigable,
deep-thinking Germany comes to our aid.
The editor of these sheets has lately received a new
book from Professor TeufelsdrÃ¶ckh, of Weissnichtwo,
treating expressly of "Clothes, their Origin and Influence"
(1831). This extensive volume, a very sea of
thought, discloses to us not only a new branch of philosophy,
but also the strange personal character of Professor
TeufelsdrÃ¶ckh, which is scarcely less interesting.
We were just considering how the extraordinary doctrines
of this book might best be imparted to our own
English nation, when we received a letter from Herr
Hofrath Heuschrecke, our professor's chief associate,
offering us the requisite documents for a biography of
TeufelsdrÃ¶ckh. This was the origin of our "Sartor Resartus,"
now presented in the vehicle of "Frazer's
Magazine."</p>

<p>Professor TeufelsdrÃ¶ckh, when we knew him at
Weissnichtwo, lived a still and self-contained life, devoted
to the higher philosophies and to a certain speculative
radicalism. The last words that he spoke in our
hearing were to propose a toast in the coffee-house&mdash;"The
cause of the poor, in heaven's name and the devil's."
But we looked for nothing moral from him, still
less anything didactico-religious.</p>

<p>Brave TeufelsdrÃ¶ckh, who could tell what lurked in
thee? In thine eyes, deep under thy shaggy brows, and
looking out so still and dreamy, have we not noticed
gleams of an ethereal or else a diabolic fire? Our
friend's title was that of Professor of Things in General,
but he never delivered any course. We used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
sit with him in his attic, overlooking the town; he would
contemplate that wasp-nest or bee-hive spread out below
him, and utter the strangest thoughts. "That living
flood, pouring through these streets, is coming from
eternity, going onward to eternity. These are apparitions.
What else?" Thus he lived and meditated with
Heuschrecke as Boswell for his Johnson.</p>

<p>"As Montesquieu wrote a 'Spirit of Laws,'" observes
our professor, "so could I write a 'Spirit of Clothes,'
for neither in tailoring nor in legislating does man proceed
by mere accident, but the hand is ever guided by
the mysterious operations of the mind." And so he
deals with Paradise and fig-leaves, and proceeds to view
the costumes of all mankind, in all countries, in all
times.</p>

<p>The first purpose of clothes, he imagines, was not
warmth or decency, but ornament. "Yet what have
they not become? Increased security and pleasurable
heat soon followed; divine shame or modesty, as yet a
stranger to the anthropophagous bosom, arose there
mysteriously under clothes, a mystic shrine for the holy
in man. Clothes gave us individuality, distinctions, social
polity; clothes have made men of us; they are threatening
to make clothes-screens of us."</p>

<p>TeufelsdrÃ¶ckh dwells chiefly on the seams, tatters, and
unsightly wrong-side of clothes, but he has also a superlative
transcendentalism. To him, man is a soul, a
spirit, and divine apparition, whose flesh and senses are
but a garment. He deals much in the feeling of wonder,
insisting that wonder is the only reasonable temper
for the denizen of our planet. "Wonder," he says, "is
the basis of worship," and that progress of science,
which is to destroy wonder and substitute mensuration
and numeration, finds small favour with him. "Clothes,
despicable as we think them, are unspeakably significant."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;Biography of TeufelsdrÃ¶ckh</i></h4>

<p>So far as we can gather from the disordered papers
which have been placed in our hands, the genesis of
Diogenes TeufelsdrÃ¶ckh is obscure. We see nothing
but an exodus out of invisibility into visibility. In the
village of Entepfuhl we find a childless couple, verging
on old age. Andreas Futteral, who has been a grenadier
sergeant under Frederick the Great, is now cultivating
a little orchard. To him and Gretchen his wife there
entered one evening a stranger of reverend aspect, who
deposited a silk-covered basket, saying, "Good people,
here is an invaluable loan; take all heed thereof; with
high recompense, or else with heavy penalty, will it one
day be required back." Therein they found, as soon as
he had departed, a little infant in the softest sleep. Our
philosopher tells us that this story, told him in his twelfth
year, produced a quite indelible impression. Who was
his unknown father, whom he was never able to meet?</p>

<p>We receive glimpses of his childhood, schooldays, and
university life, and then meet with him in that difficulty,
common to young men, of "getting under way." "Not
what I have," he says, "but what I do, is my kingdom;
and we should grope throughout our lives from one expectation
and disappointment to another were we not
saved by one thing&mdash;our hunger." He had thrown up
his legal profession, and found himself without landmark
of outward guidance; whereby his previous want
of decided belief, or inward guidance, is frightfully aggravated.
So he sets out over an unknown sea; but a
certain Calypso Island at the very outset falsifies his
whole reckoning.</p>

<p>"Nowhere," he says, "does Heaven so immediately
reveal itself to the young man as in the young maiden.
The feeling of our young forlorn towards the queens of
this earth was, and indeed is, altogether unspeakable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
A visible divinity dwelt in them; to our young friend
all women were holy, were heavenly. And if, on a soul
so circumstanced, some actual air-maiden should cast
kind eyes, saying thereby, 'Thou too mayest love and
be loved,' and so kindle him&mdash;good Heaven, what an
all-consuming fire were probably kindled!"</p>

<p>Such a fire of romance did actually burst forth in Herr
Diogenes. We know not who "Blumine" was, nor how
they met. She was young, hazel-eyed, beautiful, high-born,
and of high spirit, but unhappily dependent and
insolvent, living perhaps on the bounty of moneyed relatives.
"To our friend the hours seemed moments; holy
was he and happy; the words from those sweetest lips
came over him like dew on thirsty grass. At parting,
the Blumine's hand was in his; in the balmy twilight,
with the kind stars above them, he spoke something of
meeting again, which was not contradicted; he pressed
gently those soft, small fingers, and it seemed as if they
were not hastily, not angrily withdrawn."</p>

<p>Poor TeufelsdrÃ¶ckh, it is clear to demonstration thou
art smit! Flame-clad, thou art scaling the upper
Heaven, and verging towards insanity, for prize of a
high-souled brunette, as if the earth held but one and
not several of these! "One morning, he found his
morning-star all dimmed and dusky-red; doomsday had
dawned; they were to meet no more!" Their lips were
joined for the first time and the last, and TeufelsdrÃ¶ckh
was made immortal by a kiss. And then&mdash;"thick curtains
of night rushed over his soul, and he fell, through
the ruins as of a shivered universe, towards the abyss."</p>

<p>He quietly lifts his pilgrim-staff, and begins a perambulation
and circumambulation of the terraqueous globe.
We find him in Paris, in Vienna, in Tartary, in the Sahara,
flying with hunger always parallel to him, and a
whole infernal chase in his rear. He traverses mountains
and valleys with aimless speed, writing with footprints
his sorrows, that his spirit may free herself, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
he become a man. Vain truly is the hope of your swiftest
runner to escape from his own shadow! We behold
him, through these dim years, in a state of crisis, of
transition; his aimless pilgrimings are but a mad fermentation,
wherefrom, the fiercer it is, the clearer
product will one day evolve itself.</p>

<p>Man has no other possession but hope; this world of
his is emphatically the "Place of Hope"; yet our professor,
for the present, is quite shut out from hope. As
he wanders wearisomely through this world he has now
lost all tidings of another and higher. "Doubt," says
he, "had darkened into unbelief." It is all a grim desert,
this once fair world of his; and no pillar of cloud
by day, and no pillar of fire by night, any longer guides
the pilgrim. "Invisible yet impenetrable walls, as of
enchantment, divided me from all living; was there, in
the wide world, any true bosom I could press trustfully
to mine? O Heaven, no, there was none! To me the
universe was all void of life, of purpose, of volition, even
of hostility; it was one huge, dead, immeasurable steam-engine,
rolling on, in its dead indifference, to grind me
limb from limb. O, the vast, gloomy, solitary Golgotha,
and mill of death!</p>

<p>"Full of such humour, and perhaps the miserablest
man in the whole French capital or suburbs, was I, one
sultry dog-day, after much perambulation, toiling along
the dirty little Rue Saint Thomas de l'Enfer, among
civic rubbish enough, in a close atmosphere, and over
pavements hot as Nebuchadnezzar's furnace; whereby
doubtless my spirits were a little cheered; when, all at
once, there rose a thought in me, and I asked myself,
'What <em>art</em> thou afraid of? Wherefore, like a coward,
dost thou forever pip and whimper, and go cowering
and trembling? Despicable biped! what is the sum-total
of the worst that lies before thee? Death? Well, death;
and say the pangs of Tophet too, and all that the devil
and man may, will, or can do against thee! Hast thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
not a heart; canst thou not suffer whatever it be; and,
as a child of freedom, though outcast, trample Tophet
itself under thy feet, while it consumes thee? Let it
come, then; I will meet it and defy it!' And, as I so
thought, there rushed like a stream of fire over my whole
soul; and I shook base fear away from me for ever. Ever
from that time, the temper of my misery was changed;
not fear or whining sorrow was it, but indignation and
grim fire-eyed defiance.</p>

<p>"Thus had the <em>Everlasting No</em> pealed authoritatively
through all the recesses of my being, of my <em>Me</em>; and
then was it that my whole <em>Me</em> stood up, in native God-created
majesty, and with emphasis recorded its protest.
The Everlasting No had said, 'Behold, thou art fatherless,
outcast, and the universe is mine, the devil's'; to
which my whole <em>Me</em> now made answer, 'I am not thine,
but free, and for ever hate thee!'</p>

<p>"It is from this hour that I incline to date my spiritual
new-birth, or Baphometic Fire-baptism; perhaps
I directly thereupon began to be a man."</p>

<p>Our wanderer's unrest was for a time but increased.
"Indignation and defiance are not the most peaceable
inmates," yet it was no longer a quite hopeless unrest.
He looked away from his own sorrows, over the many-coloured
world, and few periods of his life were richer
in spiritual culture than this. He had reached the Centre
of Indifference wherein he had accepted his own nothingness.
"I renounced utterly, I would hope no more
and fear no more. To die or to live was to me alike
insignificant. Here, then, as I lay in that Centre of Indifference,
cast by benignant upper influence into a healing
sleep, the heavy dreams rolled gradually away, and
I awoke to a new heaven and a new earth. I saw that
man can do without happiness and instead thereof find
blessedness. Love not pleasure; love God. This is the
<em>Everlasting Yea</em>, wherein all contradiction is solved;
wherein whoso walks and works, it is well with him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
In this poor, miserable, hampered, despicable Actual,
wherein thou even now standest, here or nowhere is thy
Ideal; work it out therefrom; and working, believe, live,
be free! Produce! produce! Work while it is called
to-day."</p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;The Volume on Clothes</i></h4>

<p>In so capricious a work as this of the professor's, our
course cannot be straightforward, but only leap by leap,
noting significant indications here and there. Thus,
"perhaps the most remarkable incident in modern history,"
he says, "is George Fox's making to himself a
suit of leather, when, desiring meditation and devout
prayer to God, he took to the woods, chose the hollow
of a tree for his lodging and wild berries for his food,
and for clothes stitched himself one perennial suit of
leather. Then was there in broad Europe one free man,
and Fox was he!"</p>

<p>Under the title "Church-Clothes," by which TeufelsdrÃ¶ckh
signifies the forms, the vestures, under which
men have at various periods embodied and represented
for themselves the religious principle, he says, "These
are unspeakably the most important of all the vestures
and garnitures of human existence. Church-clothes are
first spun and woven by society; outward religion originates
by society; society becomes possible by religion."</p>

<p>Of "symbols," as means of concealment and yet of
revelation, thus uniting in themselves the efficacies at
once of speech and of silence, our professor writes, "In
the symbol proper there is ever, more or less distinctly
and directly, some embodiment and revelation of the
Infinite; the Infinite is made to blend itself with the
finite; to stand visible, and, as it were, attainable there.
Of this sort are all true works of art; in them, if thou
know a work of art from a daub of artifice, wilt thou
discern eternity looking through time; the God-like rendered
visible. But nobler than all in this kind are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
lives of heroic God-inspired men, for what other work
of art is so divine?" And again, "Of this be certain,
wouldst thou plant for eternity, then plant into the deep
infinite faculties of man, his fantasy and heart; wouldst
thou plant for year and day, then plant into his shallow
superficial faculties, his self-love and arithmetical understanding."</p>

<p>As for Helotage, or that lot of the poor wherein no
ray of heavenly nor even of earthly knowledge visits him,
TeufelsdrÃ¶ckh says, "That there should one man die
ignorant who had capacity for knowledge, this I call a
tragedy, were it to happen more than twenty times in
the minute."</p>

<p>In another place, our professor meditates upon the
awful procession of mankind. "Like a God-created,
fire-breathing spirit-host, we emerge from the inane;
haste stormfully across the astonished earth; then
plunge again into the inane. But whence?&mdash;O Heaven,
whither? Sense knows not; Faith knows not; only
that it is through mystery to mystery, from God and to
God.</p>

<h3>Concerning Friendship</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The dialogue "Concerning Friendship" was composed immediately
after the assassination of Julius CÃ¦sar, and was suggested
by the conduct of certain friends of the mighty dead,
who were trying, in the name of friendship, to inflame the
populace against the cause of the conspirators. (Cicero biography,
see Vol. IX, p. 155, and also p. <a href="#Page_274">274</a> of the present volume.)</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>A Dialogue</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Fannius</span>: I agree with you, LÃ¦lius; never was man
better known for justice or for glory than Scipio Africanus.
That is why everyone in Rome is looking to you;
everyone is asking me, and ScÃ¦vola here, how the wise
LÃ¦lius is bearing the loss of his dead friend. For they
call you wise, you know, in the same sense as the oracle
called Socrates wise, because you believe that your happiness
depends on yourself alone, and that virtue can
fortify the soul against every calamity. May we know,
then, how you bear your sorrow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ScÃ¦vola</span>: He says truly; many have asked me the
same question. I tell them that you are composed and
patient, though deeply touched by the death of your
dearest friend, and one of the greatest of men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">LÃ¦lius</span>: You have answered well. True it is that I
sorrow for a friend whose like I shall never see again;
but it is also true that I need no consolations, since I
believe that no evil has befallen Scipio. Whatever misfortune
there is, is my misfortune, and any immoderate
distress would show self-love, not love for him. What
a man he was! Well, he is in heaven; and I sometimes
hope that the friendship of Scipio and LÃ¦lius may live
in human memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Fannius</span>: Yes&mdash;your friendship: what do you believe
about friendship?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ScÃ¦vola</span>: That's what we want to know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">LÃ¦lius</span>: Who am I, to speak on such a subject all on
a sudden? You should go to these Greek professionals,
who can spin you a discourse on anything at a moment's
notice. For my part, I can only advise this&mdash;prize
friendship above all earthly things. We seem to be made
for friendship; it is our great stand-by whether in weal
or woe. Yet I can say this too: friendship cannot be
except among the good. I don't mean a fantastical and
unattainable pitch of goodness such as the philosophers
prate about; I mean the genuine, commonplace goodness
of flesh and blood, that actually exists. I mean such
men as live in honour, justice, and liberality, and are
consistent, and are neither covetous nor licentious, nor
brazen-faced; such men are good enough for us, because
they follow Nature as far as they can.</p>

<p>Friendship consists of a perfect conformity of opinion
upon all subjects, divine and human, together with a
feeling of kindness and attachment. And though some
prefer riches, health, power, honours, or even pleasure,
no greater boon than friendship, with the single exception
of wisdom, has been given by the gods to man. It
is quite true that our highest good depends on virtue; but
virtue inevitably begets and nourishes friendship. What
a part, for instance, friendship has played in the lives of
the good men we have known&mdash;the Catos, the Galli, the
Scipios, and the like!</p>

<p>How manifold, again, are its benefits! What greater
delight is there than to have one with whom you may
talk as if with yourself? One who will joy in your good
fortune, and bear the heaviest end of your burdens!
Other things are good for particular purposes, friendship
for all; neither water nor fire has so many uses.
But in one respect friendship transcends everything
else: it throws a brilliant gleam of hope over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
future, and banishes despondency. Whoever has a true
friend sees in him a reflection of himself; and each
is strong in the strength and rich in the wealth of the
other.</p>

<p>If you consider that the principle of harmony and
benevolence is necessary to the very existence of families
and states, you will understand how high a thing is
friendship, in which that harmony and benevolence reach
their perfect flower. There was a philosopher of Agrigentum
who explained the properties of matter and the
movements of bodies in terms of affection and repulsion;
and however that may be, everyone knows that these are
the real forces in human life. Who does not applaud
the friendship that shares in mortal dangers, whether in
real life or in the play?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ScÃ¦vola</span>: You speak highly of friendship. What are
its principles and duties?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">LÃ¦lius</span>: Do we desire a friend because of our own
weakness and deficiency, in order that we may obtain from
him what we lack ourselves, repaying him by reciprocal
service? Or is all that only an incident of friendship,
and does the bond derive from a remoter and more beautiful
origin, in the heart of Nature herself? For my
part, I take the latter view. Friendship is a natural
emotion, and not an arrangement of convenience. Its
character may be recognised even in the lower animals,
and much more plainly in the love of human parents for
their children, and, most of all, in our affection for a
congenial friend, whom we see in an atmosphere of
virtue and worth.</p>

<p>The other is not an ignoble theory, but it leaves us in
the difficulty that if it were true, the weakest, meanest,
and poorest of humanity would be the most inclined to
friendship. But it is the strong, rich, independent, and
self-reliant man, deeply founded in wisdom and dignity,
who makes great friendships. What did Africanus need
of me, or I of him? Advantages followed, but they did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
not lead. But there are people who will always be referring
everything to the one principle of self-advantage;
they have no eyes for anything great and god-like. Let
us leave such theorists alone; the plain fact is, that whenever
worth is seen, love for it is enkindled. Associations
founded upon interest presently dissolve, because interest
changes; but Nature never changes, and therefore true
friendships are imperishable.</p>

<p>Scipio used to say that it was exceedingly difficult to
carry on a friendship to the end of life, because the paths
of interest so often diverge. There may be competition
for office, or a dishonorable request may be refused, or
some other accident may be fatal to the bond. This
refusal to join in a nefarious course of action is often
the end of a friendship, and it is worth inquiring how
far the claims of affection ought to extend. Tiberius
Gracchus, when he troubled the state, was deserted by
almost all his friends; one of them who had assisted him
told me that he had such high regard for Gracchus that
he could refuse him nothing. "But what," said I, "if
he had asked you to set fire to the capitol?" "I would
have done it!"</p>

<p>What an infamous confession! No degree of friendship
can justify a crime; and since virtue is the foundation
of friendship, crime must inevitably undermine it.
Let this, then, be the rule of friendship&mdash;never to make
disgraceful requests, and never to grant them when they
are made.</p>

<p>Among the perverse, over-subtle ideas of certain
Greek philosophers is the maxim that we should be very
cool in the matter of friendship. They say that we have
enough to do with our own affairs, without taking on
other people's affairs too; and that our minds cannot be
serenely at leisure if we are liable to be tortured by the
sorrows of a friend. They advise, also, that friendships
should be sought for the sake of protection, and not for
the sake of kindliness. O noble philosophy! They put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
out the sun in the heavens, and offer us instead a freedom
from care that is worse than worthless. Virtue has
not a heart of stone, but is gentle and compassionate,
rejoicing with the joyful and weeping with those who
mourn. True virtue is never unsocial, never haughty.</p>

<p>With regard to the limits of friendship, I have heard
three several maxims, but disapprove them all. First,
that we ought to feel towards our friend exactly as we
feel towards ourselves. That would never do; for we
do many things for our friends that we should never
think of doing for ourselves. We ask favours and reprehend
injuries for a friend, where we would not solicit
for, or defend, ourselves. Secondly, that our kindness
to a friend should be meted out in precise equipoise to
his kindness to us. This is too miserable a theory:
friendship is opulent and generous. The third is, that
we should take our friend's own estimate of himself, and
act upon it. This is the worst principle of the three; for
if our friend is over-humble, diffident or despondent, it
is the very business of friendship to cheer him and urge
him on. But Scipio used to condemn yet another principle
that is worse still. Some one&mdash;he thought it must
have been a bad man&mdash;once said that we ought to remember
in friendship that some day the friend might be
an enemy. How, in that state of mind, could one be a
friend at all?</p>

<p>A sound principle, I think, is this. In the friendship
of upright men there ought to be an unrestricted communication
of every interest, every purpose, every inclination.
Then, in any matter of importance to the life
or reputation of your friend, you may deviate a little
from the strictest line of conduct so long as you do not
do anything that is actually infamous. Then, with regard
to the choice of friends, Scipio used to say that men
were more careful about their sheep and goats than
about their friends. Choose men of constancy, solidity,
and firmness; and until their trustworthiness has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
tested, be moderate in your affection and confidence.
Seek first of all for sincerity. Your friend should also
have an open, genial, and sociable temper, and his sympathies
should be the same as yours. He must not be
ready to believe accusations. Lastly, his talk and manner
should be debonair; we don't want austerities and
solemnities in friendship.</p>

<p>I have heard it suggested that we ought perhaps to
prefer new friends to old, as we prefer a young horse
to an old one. Satiety should have no place in friendship.
Old wines are the best, and so are the friends of
many years. Do not despise the acquaintance that promises
to ripen into something better; but do not sacrifice
for it the deeply rooted intimacy. Even inanimate things
take hold of our hearts by long custom; we love the
mountains and forests of our youth.</p>

<p>There is often a great disparity in respect of rank or
talent between intimate friends. Whenever that is so,
let the superior place himself on the level of the inferior;
let him share all his advantages with his friend. The
best way to reap the full harvest of genius, or of merit,
or of any other excellence, is to encourage all one's kindred
and associates to enjoy it too. But if the superior
ought to condescend to the inferior, so the inferior ought
to be free from envy. And let him not make a fuss
about such services as he has been able to render.</p>

<p>To pass from the noble friendships of the wise to more
commonplace intimacies, we cannot leave out of account
the necessity that sometimes arises of breaking off a
friendship. A man falls into scandalous courses, his
disgrace is reflected on his companions, and their relation
must come to an end. Well, the end had best come
gradually and gently, unless the offence is so detestable
that an abrupt and final cutting of the acquaintance is
absolutely inevitable. Disengage, if possible, rather than
cut. And let the matter end with estrangement; let it
not proceed to active animosity and hostility. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
very unbecoming to engage in public war with a man
who has been known as one's friend. On two separate
occasions Scipio thought it right to withdraw his confidence
from certain friends. In each case he kept his
dignity and self-command; he was grieved, but never
bitter. Of course, the best way to guard against such
unfortunate occurrences is to take the greatest care in
forming friendships. All excellence is rare, and that
moral excellence which makes fit objects for friendship
is as rare as any.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it would be unreasonable and presumptuous
in anyone to expect to find a friend of a
quality to which he himself can never hope to attain, or
to demand from his friend an indulgence which he is not
prepared himself to offer. Friendship was given us to
be an incentive to virtue, and not as an indulgence to vice
or to mediocrity; in order that, since a solitary virtue
cannot scale the peaks, it may do so with the loyal help
of a comrade. A comradeship of this kind includes within
it all that men most desire.</p>

<p>Think nobly of friendship, and conduct yourselves
wisely in it, for in one way or another it enters into the
life of every man. Even Timon of Athens, whose one
impulse was a brutal misanthropy, must needs seek a
confidant into whose mind he may instil his detestable
venom. I have heard, and I agree with it, that though a
man should contemplate from the heavens the universal
beauty of creation, he would soon weary of it without a
companion for his admiration.</p>

<p>Of course, there are rubs in friendship which a sensible
man will learn to avoid, or to ignore, or to bear
them cheerfully. Admonitions and reproofs must have
their part in true amity, and it is as difficult to utter them
tactfully as it is to receive them in good part. Complaisance
seems more propitious to friendship than are these
naked truths. But though truth may be painful, complaisance
is more likely in the long run to prove disastrous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
It is no kindness to allow a friend to rush headlong
to ruin. Let your remonstrances be free from bitterness
and from insult; let your complaisance be affable,
but never servile. As for adulation, there are no words
bad enough for it. Even the populace have only contempt
for the politician who flatters them. Despise the
insinuations of the sycophant, for what is more shameful
than to be made a fool of?</p>

<p>I tell you, sirs, that it is virtue that lasts; that begets
real friendships and maintains them. Lay, therefore,
while you are young, the foundations of a virtuous life.</p>

<p>William Cobbett, the celebrated English political writer, was
born in March, 1762, at Farnham in Surrey. He took a dislike
to rural occupations, and at an early age went to London, where
he was employed for a few months as a copying clerk. This
work was distasteful to him, and he enlisted in the army, and
went with his regiment to Nova Scotia. On returning to England
in 1791, he obtained his discharge, married, and went to
America. In Philadelphia he commenced his career as a political
writer. Cobbett's "Advice to Young Men" was published in
1830. It has always been the most popular of his books, partly
because of its subject, and partly because it illustrates so well
the bold and forceful directness of his style. An intensely
egotistical and confident man, Cobbett believed that his own
strangely inconsistent life was a model for all men. Yet, contrary
to what might have been expected, he was a delightful
man in the domestic circle, and the story of his marriage&mdash;which
has been narrated in his "Rural Rides"&mdash;is one of the
romances of literary life. The original introduction to the
"Advice" contained personal reference incredible in anyone
except Cobbett. Said he, "Few will be disposed to question
my fitness for the task. If such a man be not qualified to give
advice, no man is qualified." And he went on to claim for
himself "genius and something more." He certainly had a remarkable
fund of commonsense, except when his subject was
himself. Cobbett died June 18, 1835.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;To a Youth</i></h4>

<p>You are arrived, let us suppose, at the age of from
fourteen to nearly twenty, and I here offer you my
advice towards making you a happy man, useful to all
about you, and an honour to those from whom you
sprang. Start, I beseech you, with a conviction firmly
fixed in your mind that you have no right to live in
this world without doing work of some sort or other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
To wish to live on the labour of others is to contemplate
a fraud.</p>

<p>Happiness ought to be your great object, and it is
to be found only in independence. Turn your back
on what is called interest. Write it on your heart that
you will depend solely on your own merit and your
own exertions, for that which a man owes to favour
or to partiality, that same favour or partiality is constantly
liable to take from him.</p>

<p>The great source of independence the French express
in three words, "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vivre de peu</i>." "To live upon
little" is the great security against slavery; and this
precept extends to dress and other things besides food
and drink. Extravagance in dress arises from the notion
that all the people in the street will be looking at you
as you walk out; but all the sensible people that happen
to see you will think nothing at all about you. Natural
beauty of person always will and must have some weight,
even with men, and great weight with women; but this
does not want to be set off by expensive clothes.</p>

<p>A love of what is called "good eating and drinking,"
if very unamiable in a grown-up person, is perfectly
hateful in a youth. I have never known such a man
worthy of respect.</p>

<p>Next, as to amusements. Dancing is at once rational
and healthful; it is the natural amusement of
young people, and none but the most grovelling and
hateful tyranny, or the most stupid and despicable
fanaticism, ever raised its voice against it. As to
gaming, it is always criminal, either in itself or in its
tendency. The basis of it is covetousness; a desire
to take from others something for which you have
given, and intend to give, no equivalent.</p>

<p>Be careful in choosing your companions; and lay
down as a rule never to be departed from that no youth
or man ought to be called your friend who is addicted
to indecent talk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
In your manners be neither boorish nor blunt, but
even these are preferable to simpering and crawling.
Be obedient where obedience is due; for it is no act
of meanness to yield implicit and ready obedience to
those who have a right to demand it at your hands.
None are so saucy and disobedient as slaves; and,
when you come to read history, you will find that in
proportion as nations have been free has been their
reverence for the laws.</p>

<p>Let me now turn to the things which you ought
to do. And, first of all, the husbanding of your time.
Young people require more sleep than those that are
grown up, and the number of hours cannot well be, on
an average, less than eight. An hour in bed is better
than an hours spent over the fire in an idle gossip.</p>

<p>Money is said to be power; but superior sobriety,
industry, and activity are still a more certain source
of power. Booklearning is not only proper, but highly
commendable; and portions of it are absolutely necessary
in every case of trade or profession. One of these
portions is distinct reading, plain and neat writing, and
arithmetic. The next thing is the grammar of your
own language, for grammar is the foundation of all
literature. Excellence in your own calling is the first
thing to be aimed at. After this may come general
knowledge. Geography naturally follows grammar;
and you should begin with that of this kingdom.
When you come to history, begin also with that of
your own country; and here it is my bounded duty to
put you well on your guard. The works of our historians
are, as far as they relate to former times, masses
of lies unmatched by any others that the world has
ever seen.</p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;To a Young Man</i></h4>

<p>To be poor and independent is very nearly an impossibility;
though poverty is, except where there is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
actual want of food and raiment, a thing much more
imaginary than real. Resolve to set this false shame
of being poor at defiance. Nevertheless, men ought
to take care of their names, ought to use them prudently
and sparingly, and to keep their expenses always
within the bounds of their income, be it what it may.</p>

<p>One of the effectual means of doing this is to purchase
with ready money. Innumerable things are not
bought at all with ready money which would be bought
in case of trust; it is so much easier to order a thing
than to pay for it. I believe that, generally speaking,
you pay for the same article a fourth part more in the
case of trust than you do in the case of ready money.
The purchasing with ready money really means that
you have more money to purchase with.</p>

<p>A great evil arising from the desire not to be thought
poor is the destructive thing honoured by the name of
"speculation," but which ought to be called gambling.
It is a purchasing of something to be sold again with
a great profit at a considerable hazard. Your life,
while you are thus engaged, is the life of a gamester:
a life of general gloom, enlivened now and then by
a gleam of hope or of success.</p>

<p>In all situations of life avoid the trammels of the
law. If you win your suit and are poorer than you
were before, what do you accomplish? Better to put
up with the loss of one pound than with two, with
all the loss of time and all the mortification and anxiety
attending a law suit.</p>

<p>Unless your business or your profession be duly attended
to there can be no real pleasure in any other
employment of a portion of your time. Men, however,
must have some leisure, some relaxation from business;
and in the choice of this relaxation much of your happiness
will depend.</p>

<p>Where fields and gardens are at hand, they present
the most rational scenes for leisure. Nothing can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
more stupid than sitting, sotting over a pot and a glass,
sending out smoke from the head, and articulating, at
intervals, nonsense about all sorts of things.</p>

<p>Another mode of spending the leisure time is that
of books. To come at the true history of a country
you must read its laws; you must read books treating
of its usages and customs in former times; and you
must particularly inform yourselves as to prices of labour
and of food. But there is one thing always to be
guarded against, and that is not to admire and applaud
anything you read merely because it is the fashion to
admire and applaud it. Read, consider well what you
read, form your own judgments, and stand by that
judgment until fact or argument be offered to convince
you of your error.</p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;To a Lover</i></h4>

<p>There are two descriptions of lovers on whom all
advice would be wasted, namely, those in whose minds
passion so wholly overpowers reason as to deprive the
party of his sober senses, and those who love according
to the rules of arithmetic, or measure their matrimonial
expectations by the claim of the land-surveyor.</p>

<p>I address myself to the reader whom I suppose to
be a real lover, but not so smitten as to be bereft of
reason. You should never forget that marriage is a
thing to last for life, and that, generally speaking, it is
to make life happy or miserable.</p>

<p>The things which you ought to desire in a wife are
chastity, sobriety, industry, frugality, cleanliness,
knowledge of domestic affairs, good temper and beauty.</p>

<p>Chastity, perfect modesty, in word, deed, and even
thought, is so essential that without it no female is fit
to be a wife. If prudery mean false modesty, it is to
be despised; but if it mean modesty pushed to the utmost
extent, I confess that I like it. The very elements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
of jealousy ought to be avoided, and the only
safeguard is to begin well and so render infidelity and
jealousy next to impossible.</p>

<p>By sobriety I mean sobriety of conduct. When
girls arrive at that age which turns their thoughts towards
the command of a house it is time for them to
cast away the levity of a child. Sobriety is a title to
trustworthiness, and that is a treasure to prize above
all others. But in order to possess this precious trustworthiness
you must exercise your reason in the choice
of a partner. If she be vain, fond of flattery, given to
gadding about, coquettish, she will never be trustworthy,
and you will be unjust if you expect it at her
hands. But if you find in her that innate sobriety of
which I have been speaking, there requires on your
part confidence and trust without any limit.</p>

<p>An ardent-minded young man may fear that sobriety
of conduct in a young woman argues a want of
warmth; but my observation and experience tell me
that levity, not sobriety, is, ninety-nine times out of a
hundred, the companion of a want of ardent feeling.</p>

<p>There is no state in life in which industry in the
wife is not necessary to the happiness and prosperity
of the family. If she be lazy there will always be a
heavy arrear of things unperformed, and this, even
among the wealthy, is a great curse. But who is to
tell whether a girl will make an industrious woman?
There are certain outward signs, which, if attended to
with care, will serve as pretty sure guides.</p>

<p>If you find the tongue lazy you may be nearly certain
that the hands and feet are the same. The pronunciation
of an industrious person is generally quick,
distinct, and firm. Another mark of industry is a quick
step and a tread showing that the foot comes down
with a hearty good will.</p>

<p>Early rising is another mark of industry. It is, I
should imagine, pretty difficult to keep love alive towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
a woman who never sees the dew, never beholds
the rising sun.</p>

<p>Frugality. This means the contrary of extravagance.
It does not mean stinginess; it means an abstaining
from all unnecessary expenditure. The outward and
vulgar signs of extravagance are all the hardware
which women put upon their persons. The girl who
has not the sense to perceive that her person is disfigured,
and not beautified by parcels of brass, tin, and
other hardware stuck about her body, is too great a
fool to be trusted with the purse of any man.</p>

<p>Cleanliness is a capital ingredient. Occasional cleanliness
is not the thing that an English or American
husband wants; he wants it always. A sloven in one
thing is a sloven in all things. Make up your mind to
a rope rather than to live with a slip-shod wife.</p>

<p>Knowledge of domestic affairs is so necessary in
every wife that the lover ought to have it continually
in his eye. A wife must not only know how things
ought to be done, but how to do them. I cannot form
an idea of a more unfortunate being than a girl with
a mere boarding-school education and without a future
to enable her to keep a servant when married. Of
what use are her accomplishments?</p>

<p>Good temper is a very difficult thing to ascertain
beforehand&mdash;smiles are so cheap. By "good temper"
I do not mean easy temper&mdash;a serenity which nothing
disturbs is a mark of laziness. Sulkiness, querulousness,
cold indifference, pertinacity in having the last
word, are bad things in a young woman, but of all the
faults of temper your melancholy ladies are the worst.
Most wives are at times misery-makers, but the melancholy
carry it on as a regular trade.</p>

<p>The great use of female beauty is that it naturally
tends to keep the husband in good humour with himself,
to make him pleased with his bargain.</p>

<p>As to constancy in lovers, even when marriage has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
been promised, and that, too, in the most solemn
manner, it is better for both parties to break off than to
be coupled together with the reluctant assent of either.</p>

<h4><i>IV.&mdash;To a Husband</i></h4>

<p>It is as a husband that your conduct will have the
greatest effect on your happiness. All in a wife, beyond
her own natural disposition and education, is,
nine times out of ten, the work of her husband.</p>

<p>First convince her of the necessity of moderation in
expense; make her clearly see the justice of beginning
to act upon the presumption that there are children
coming. The great danger of all is beginning with a
servant. The wife is young, and why is she not to
work as well as her husband? If the wife be not able
to do all the work to be done in the house, she ought
not to have been able to marry.</p>

<p>The next thing to be attended to is your demeanour
towards a young wife. The first frown that she receives
from you is a dagger to her heart. Let nothing
put you out of humour with her.</p>

<p>Every husband who spends his leisure time in company
other than that of his wife and family tells her
and them that he takes more delight in other company
than in theirs. Resolve from the very first never
to spend an hour from home unless business or some
necessary and rational purpose demand it. If you
are called away your wife ought to be fully apprised
of the probable duration of the absence and of the time
of return. When we consider what a young woman
gives up on her wedding day, how can a just man think
anything a trifle that affects her happiness?</p>

<p>Though these considerations may demand from us
the kindest possible treatment of a wife, the husband is
to expect dutiful deportment at her hands. A husband
under command is the most contemptible of God's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
creatures. Am I recommending tyranny? Am I recommending
disregard of the wife's opinions and wishes?
By no means. But the very nature of things prescribes
that there must be a head of every house, and
an undivided authority. The wife ought to be heard,
and patiently heard; she ought to be reasoned with,
and, if possible, convinced; but if she remain opposed
to the husband's opinion, his will must be
obeyed.</p>

<p>I now come to that great bane of families&mdash;jealousy.
One thing every husband can do in the way of prevention,
and that is to give no ground for it. Few characters
are more despicable than that of a jealous-headed
husband, and that, not because he has grounds,
but because he has not grounds.</p>

<p>If to be happy in the married state requires these
precautions, you may ask: Is it not better to remain
single? The cares and troubles of the married life are
many, but are those of the single life few? Without
wives men are poor, helpless mortals.</p>

<p>As to the expense, I firmly believe that a farmer
married at twenty-five, and having ten children during
the first ten years, would be able to save more money
during these years than a bachelor of the same age
would be able to save, on the same farm, in a like
space of time. The bachelor has no one on whom he
can in all cases rely. To me, no being in this world
appears so wretched as he.</p>

<h4><i>V.&mdash;To a Father</i></h4>

<p>It is yourself that you see in your children. They
are the great and unspeakable delight of your youth,
the pride of your prime of life, and the props of your
old age. From the very beginning ensure in them, if
possible, an ardent love for their mother. Your first
duty towards them is resolutely to prevent their drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
the means of life from any breast but hers. That
is their own; it is their birthright.</p>

<p>The man who is to gain a living by his labour must
be drawn away from home; but this will not, if he be
made of good stuff, prevent him from doing his share
of the duty due to his children. There ought to be no
toils, no watchings, no breakings of rest, imposed by
this duty, of which he ought not to perform his full
share, and that, too, without grudging. The working
man, in whatever line, and whether in town or country,
who spends his day of rest away from his wife and
children is not worthy of the name of father.</p>

<p>The first thing in the rearing of children who have
passed from the baby state is, as to the body, plenty
of good food; and, as to the mind, constant good example
in the parents. There is no other reason for the
people in the American states being generally so much
taller and stronger than the people in England are, but
that, from their birth, they have an abundance of good
food; not only of food, but of rich food. Nor is this,
in any point of view, an unimportant matter, for a tall
man is worth more than a short man. Good food, and
plenty of it, is not more necessary to the forming of a
stout and able body than to the forming of an active
and enterprising spirit. Children should eat often, and
as much as they like at a time. They will never take,
of plain food, more than it is good for them to take.</p>

<p>The next thing after good and plentiful and plain
food is good air. Besides sweet air, children want exercise.
Even when they are babies in arms they want
tossing and pulling about, and talking and singing to.
They will, when they begin, take, if you let them alone,
just as much exercise as nature bids them, and no
more.</p>

<p>I am of opinion that it is injurious to the mind to
press book-learning upon a child at an early age. I
must impress my opinion upon every father that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
children's happiness ought to be his first object; that
book-learning, if it tend to militate against this, ought
to be disregarded. A man may read books for ever
and be an ignorant creature at last, and even the more
ignorant for his reading.</p>

<p>And with regard to young women, everlasting book-reading
is absolutely a vice. When they once get into
the habit they neglect all other matters, and, in some
cases, even their very dress. Attending to the affairs
of the house&mdash;to the washing, the baking, the brewing,
the cooking of victuals, the management of the poultry
and the garden, these are their proper occupations.</p>

<h4><i>VI.&mdash;To the Citizen</i></h4>

<p>Having now given my advice to the youth, the man,
the lover, the husband, and the father, I shall tender
it to the citizen. To act well our part as citizens we
ought clearly to understand what our rights are; for
on our enjoyment of these depend our duties, rights
going before duties, as value received goes before payments.
The great right of all is the right of taking
a part in the making of the laws by which we are governed.</p>

<p>It is the duty of every man to defend his country
against an enemy, a duty imposed by the law of nature
as well as by that of civil society. Yet how are you to
maintain that this is the duty of every man if you deny
to some men the enjoyment of a share in making the
laws? The poor man has a body and a soul as well
as the rich man; like the latter, he has parents, wife,
and children; a bullet or a sword is as deadly to him
as to the rich man; yet, notwithstanding this equality,
he is to risk all, and, if he escape, he is still to be denied
an equality of rights! Why are the poor to risk
their lives? To uphold the laws and to protect property&mdash;property
of which they are said to possess none?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
What! compel men to come forth and risk their lives
for the protection of property, and then in the same
breath tell them that they are not allowed to share in
the making of the laws, because, and only because,
they have no property!</p>

<p>Here, young man of sense and of spirit, here is the
point on which you are to take your stand. There are
always men enough to plead the cause of the rich, and
to echo the woes of the fallen great; but be it your part
to show compassion for those who labour, and to maintain
their rights.</p>

<p>If the right to have a share in making the laws were
merely a feather, if it were a fanciful thing, if it were
only a speculative theory, if it were but an abstract
principle, it might be considered as of little importance.
But it is none of these; it is a practical matter. Who
lets another man put his hand into his purse when he
pleases? It is the first duty of every man to do all in
his power to maintain this right of self-government
where it exists, and to restore it where it has been lost.
Men are in such a case labouring, not for the present
day only, but for ages to come. If life should not allow
them time to see their endeavours crowned, their
children will see it.</p>

<h3>A Journal of the Plague Year</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"A Journal of the Plague Year" appeared in 1722. In its
second edition it received the title of "A History of the
Plague." This book was suggested by the public anxiety caused
by a fearful visitation of the plague at Marseilles in the two
preceding years. As an account of the epidemic in London, it
has all the vividness of Defoe's fiction, while it is acknowledged
to be historically accurate. (Defoe biography, see Vol. III, p. 26.)</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;A Stricken City</i></h4>

<p>It was about the beginning of September, 1664, that I,
among the rest of my neighbours, heard that the plague
was returned again in Holland. We had no such thing
as printed newspapers in those days to spread rumours
and reports of things; but such things as these were
gathered from the letters of merchants, and from them
were handed about by word of mouth only. In December,
two Frenchmen died of the plague in Long Acre, or,
rather, at the upper end of Drury Lane. The secretaries
of state got knowledge of it, and two physicians and a
surgeon were ordered to go to the house and make inspection.
This they did, and, finding evident tokens of
the sickness upon both the bodies, they gave their opinions
publicly, that they died of the plague; whereupon it was
given in to the parish clerk, and he also returned them
to the Hall; and it was printed in the weekly bill of
mortality in the usual manner, thus:</p>

<p class="center">
Plague, 2; Parishes infected, 1.<br />
</p>

<p>The distemper spread slowly, and in the beginning of
May, the city being healthy, we began to hope that as the
infection was chiefly among the people at the other end
of the town, it might go no further. We continued in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
these hopes for a few days, but it was only for a few, for
the people were no more to be deceived thus; they
searched the houses, and found that the plague was really
spread every way, and that many died of it every day;
and accordingly, in the weekly bill for the next week, the
thing began to show itself. There was, indeed, but fourteen
set down of the plague, but this was all knavery and
collusion.</p>

<p>Now the weather set in hot, and from the first week in
June the infection spread in a dreadful manner, and the
bills rose high. Yet all that could conceal their distempers
did it to prevent their neighbours shunning them,
and also to prevent authority shutting up their houses.</p>

<p>I lived without Aldgate, midway between Aldgate
church and Whitechapel Bars, and our neighbourhood
continued very easy. But at the other end of the town
their consternation was very great, and the richer sort of
people, especially the nobility and gentry, from the west
part of the city, thronged out of town with their families
and servants. In Whitechapel, where I lived, nothing
was to be seen but waggons and carts, with goods, women,
servants, children, etc., all hurrying away. This was a
very terrible and melancholy thing to see, and it filled me
with very serious thoughts of the misery that was coming
upon the city.</p>

<p>I now began to consider seriously how I should dispose
of myself, whether I should resolve to stay in London, or
shut up my house and flee. I had two important things
before me: the carrying on of my business and shop, and
the preservation of my life in so dismal a calamity. My
trade was a saddler, and though a single man, I had a
family of servants and a house and warehouses filled with
goods, and to leave them all without any overseer had
been to hazard the loss of all I had in the world.</p>

<p>I had resolved to go; but, one way or other, I always
found that to appoint to go away was always crossed by
some accident or other, so as to disappoint and put it off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
again; and I advise every person, in such a case, to keep
his eye upon the particular providences which occur at
that time, and take them as intimations from Heaven of
what is his unquestioned duty to do in such a case. Add
to this, that, turning over the Bible which lay before me,
I cried out, "Well, I know not what to do; Lord, direct
me!" and at that juncture, casting my eye down, I read:
"Thou shalt not be afraid for the pestilence that walketh
in darkness.... A thousand shall fall at thy side,
and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come
nigh thee." I scarce need tell the reader that from that
moment I resolved that I would stay in the town, casting
myself entirely upon the protection of the Almighty.</p>

<p>The court removed in the month of June, and went to
Oxford, where it pleased God to preserve them; for
which I cannot say they showed any great token of thankfulness,
and hardly anything of reformation, though they
did not want being told that their crying voices might,
without breach of charity, have gone far in bringing that
terrible judgment upon the whole nation.</p>

<p>A blazing star or comet had appeared for several
months before the plague, and there had been universal
melancholy apprehensions of some dreadful calamity.
The people were at this time more addicted to prophecies,
dreams, and old wives' fables, than ever they were before
or since. Some ran about the streets with oral predictions,
one crying, "Yet forty days, and London shall be
destroyed!" Another poor naked creature cried, "Oh,
the great and dreadful God!" repeating these words continually,
with voice and countenance full of horror, and
a swift pace, and nobody could ever find him to stop.
Some saw a flaming sword in a hand coming out of a
cloud; others, hearses and coffins in the air; others, heaps
of dead bodies unburied. But those who were really
serious and religious applied themselves in a truly Christian
manner to the proper work of repentance and humiliation.
Many consciences were awakened, many hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
hearts melted into tears. People might be heard in the
streets as we passed along, calling upon God for mercy,
and saying, "I have been a thief," or "a murderer," and
the like; and none dared stop to make the least inquiry
into such things, or to comfort the poor creatures that
thus cried out. The face of London was now strangely
altered; it was all in tears; the shrieks of women and
children at the windows and doors, where their dearest
relations were dead, were enough to pierce the stoutest
heart.</p>

<p>About June, the lord mayor and aldermen began more
particularly to concern themselves for the regulation of
the city, by the shutting up of houses. Examiners were
appointed in every parish to order the house to be shut
up wherever any person sick of the infection was found.
A night watchman and a day watchman were appointed
to each infected house to prevent any person from coming
out or going into the same. Women searchers were
appointed in each parish to examine the bodies of such
as were dead, to see if they had died of the infection, and
over these were appointed physicians and chirurgeons.
Other orders were made with regard to giving notice of
sickness, sequestration of the sick, airing the goods and
bedding of the infected, burial of the dead, cleansing of
the streets, forbidding wandering beggars, loose persons,
and idle assemblages, and the like. One of these orders
was&mdash;"That every house visited be marked with a red
cross of a foot long, in the middle of the door, with these
words, '<span class="smcap">Lord have mercy upon us</span>,' to be set close over
the same cross." Many got out of their houses by
stratagem after they were shut up, and thus spread the
plague; in one place they blowed up their watchman with
gunpowder and burnt the poor fellow dreadfully, and
while he made hideous cries, the whole family got out
at the windows; others got out by bribing the watchman,
and I have seen three watchmen publicly whipped through
the streets for suffering people to go out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;How the Dead Were Buried</i></h4>

<p>I went all the first part of the time freely about the
streets, and when they dug the great pit in the churchyard
of Aldgate I could not resist going to see it. A terrible
pit it was, forty feet long, about sixteen wide, and in one
part they dug it to near twenty feet deep, until they could
go no deeper for the water. It was filled in just two
weeks, when they had thrown into it 1,114 bodies from
our own parish.</p>

<p>I got admittance into the churchyard by the sexton,
who at first refused me, but at last said: "Name of God,
go in; depend upon it, 'twill be a sermon to you, it may
be the best that ever you heard. It is a speaking sight,"
says he; and with that he opened the door and said,
"Go, if you will." I stood wavering for a good while,
but just at that interval I saw two links come over from
the end of the Minories, and heard the bellman, and
then appeared a dead-cart coming over the streets, so I
went in.</p>

<p>The scene was awful and full of terror. The cart had
in it sixteen or seventeen bodies; some were wrapped in
sheets or rugs, some little other than naked, or so loose
that what covering they had fell from them in the shooting
out of the cart, and they fell quite naked among the
rest. But the matter was not much to them, seeing they
were all dead, and were to be huddled together into the
common grave of mankind, as we may call it; for here
was no difference made, but poor and rich went together.
The cart was turned round, and the bodies shot into the
pit promiscuously.</p>

<p>There was following the cart a poor unhappy gentleman
who fell down in a swoon when the bodies were shot
into the pit. The buriers ran to him and took him up,
and after he had come to himself, they led him away to
the Pye tavern, over against the end of Houndsditch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
His case lay so heavy on my mind that after I had gone
home I must go out again into the street and go to the
Pye tavern, to inquire what became of him.</p>

<p>It was by this time one in the morning, and yet the
poor gentleman was there. The people of the house were
civil and obliging, but there was a dreadful set of fellows
that used their house, and who, in the middle of all this
horror, met there every night, and behaved with revelling
and roaring extravagances, so that the master and mistress
of the house were terrified at them. They sat in a
room next the street, and as often as the dead-cart came
along, they would open the windows and make impudent
mocks and jeers at the sad lamentations of the people,
especially if they heard the poor people call upon God
to have mercy upon them.</p>

<p>They were at this vile work when I came to the house,
ridiculing the unfortunate man, and his sorrow for his
wife and children, taunting him with want of courage to
leap into the pit and go to Heaven with them, and adding
profane and blasphemous expressions.</p>

<p>I gently reproved them, being not unknown to two of
them. But I cannot call to mind the abominable raillery
which they returned to me, making a jest of my calling
the plague the Hand of God. They continued this
wretched course three or four days; but they were, every
one of them, carried into the great pit before it was quite
filled up.</p>

<p>In my walks I had daily many dismal scenes before my
eyes, as of persons falling dead in the streets, terrible
shrieks and screechings of women, and the like. Passing
through Tokenhouse Yard, in Lothbury, of a sudden a
casement violently opened just over my head, and a
woman gave three frightful screeches, and then cried:
"Oh Death! Death! Death!" in a most inimitable tone,
which struck me with horror and a chillness in my very
blood. There was nobody to be seen in the whole street,
neither did any other window open; for people had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
curiosity now, nor could anybody help another. I went
on into Bell Alley.</p>

<p>Just in Bell Alley, at the right hand of the passage,
there was a more terrible cry than that, and I could hear
women and children run screaming about the rooms distracted.
A garret window opened, and somebody from
a window on the other side of the alley called and asked,
"What is the matter?" upon which, from the first window
it was answered: "O Lord, my old master has
hanged himself!" The other asked again: "Is he quite
dead?" And the first answered, "Ay, ay, quite dead&mdash;quite
dead and cold."</p>

<p>It is scarce credible what dreadful things happened
every day, people in the rage of the distemper, or in the
torment of their swellings, which was indeed intolerable,
oftentimes laying violent hands on themselves, throwing
themselves out at their windows, etc.; mothers murdering
their own children in their lunacy; some dying of mere
fright, without any infection; others frightened into despair,
idiocy, or madness.</p>

<p>There were a great many robberies and wicked practices
committed even in this dreadful time. The power of
avarice was so strong in some that they would run any
hazard to steal and to plunder; and in houses where all
the inhabitants had died and been carried out, they
would break in without regard to the danger of infection,
and take even the bedclothes.</p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;Universal Desolation</i></h4>

<p>For about a month together, I believe there did not die
less than 1,500 or 1,700 a day, one day with another; and
in the beginning of September good people began to think
that God was resolved to make a full end of the people in
this miserable city. Whole families, and, indeed, whole
streets of families were swept away together, and the
infection was so increased that at length they shut up no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
houses at all. People gave themselves up to their fears,
and thought that nothing was to be hoped for but an
universal desolation. It was even in the height of this
despair that it pleased God to stay His hand, and to
slacken the fury of the contagion.</p>

<p>When the people despaired of life and abandoned themselves,
it had a very strange effect for three or four
weeks; it made them bold and venturous; they were no
more shy of one another, nor restrained within doors, but
went anywhere and everywhere, and ran desperately into
any company. It brought them to crowd into the
churches; looking on themselves as all so many dead
corpses, they behaved as if their lives were of no consequence,
compared to the work which they came about
there.</p>

<p>The conduct of the lord mayor and magistrates was all
the time admirable, so that bread was always to be had in
plenty, and cheap as usual; provisions were never wanting
in the markets; the streets were kept free from all manner
of frightful objects&mdash;dead bodies, or anything unpleasant;
and for a time fires were kept burning in the streets to
cleanse the air of infection.</p>

<p>Many remedies were tried; but it is my opinion, and I
must leave it as a prescription, that the best physic against
the plague is to run away from it. I know people encourage
themselves by saying, "God is able to keep us in
the midst of danger," and this kept thousands in the town,
whose carcasses went into the great pits by cart-loads.
Yet of the pious ladies who went about distributing alms
to the poor, and visiting infected families, though I will
not undertake to say that none of those charitable people
were suffered to fall under the calamity, yet I may say
this, that I never knew any of them to fall under it.</p>

<p>Such is the precipitant disposition of our people, that
no sooner had they observed that the distemper was not
so catching as formerly, and that if it was catched it was
not so mortal, and that abundance of people who really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
fell sick recovered again daily, than they made no more
of the plague than of an ordinary fever, nor indeed so
much. They went into the very chambers where others
lay sick. This rash conduct cost a great many their
lives, who had been preserved all through the heat of the
infection, and the bills of mortality increased again four
hundred in the first week of November.</p>

<p>But it pleased God, by the continuing of wintry weather,
so to restore the health of the city that by February following
we reckoned the distemper quite ceased. The
time was not far off when the city was to be purged with
fire, for within nine months more I saw it all lying in
ashes.</p>

<p>I shall conclude the account of this calamitous year
with a stanza of my own:</p>

<h3>The Philippics</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Demosthenes, by universal consensus of opinion the greatest orator
the world has known, was born at Athens 385 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> and died
322 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> His birth took place just nineteen years after the conclusion
of the Peloponnesian War. Losing his father when he was
yet a child, his wealth was frittered away by three faithless guardians,
whom he prosecuted when he came of age. This dispute,
and some other struggles, led him into public life, and by indomitable
perseverance he overcame the difficulty constituted by
certain physical disqualifications. Identifying himself for life
entirely with the interests of Athens, he became the foremost
administrator in the state, as well as its most eloquent orator.
His stainless character, his matchless powers of advocacy, his
fervent patriotism, and his fine diplomacy, render him altogether
one of the noblest figures of antiquity. His fame rests mainly
on "The Philippics"; those magnificent orations delivered during
a series of several years against the aggressions of Philip of
Macedon; though the three "Olynthiacs," and the oration "De
CoronÃ¢," and several other speeches are monumental of the
genius of Demosthenes, more especially the "De CoronÃ¢." He
continued to resist the Macedonian domination during the career
of Alexander the Great, and was exiled, dying, it is supposed,
by poison administered by himself, at Calauria. (Cf. also p. <a href="#Page_273">273</a>
of this volume.) This epitome has been prepared from the
original Greek.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;"Men of Athens, Arouse Yourselves!"</i></h4>

<p>The subject under discussion on this occasion, men of
Athens, is not new, and there would be no need to speak
further on it if other orators deliberated wisely. First,
I advise you not to regard the present aspect of affairs,
miserable though it truly is, as entirely hopeless. For
the primary cause of the failure is your own mismanagement.
If any consider it difficult to overcome Philip
because of the power that he has attained, and because
of our disastrous loss of many fortresses, they should
remember how much he has gained by achieving alliances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
If, now, you will emulate his policy, if every citizen
will devote himself assiduously to the service of his
country, you will assuredly recover all that has been lost,
and punish Philip. For he has his enemies, even among
his pretended friends. All dread him because your inertia
has prevented you from providing any refuge for them.
Hence the height of arrogance which he now displays
and the constantly expanding area of his conquests.</p>

<p>When, men of Athens, will you realise that your attitude
is the cause of this situation? For you idle about,
indulging in gossip over circumstances, instead of grappling
with the actualities. Were this antagonist to pass
away, another enemy like him would speedily be produced
by your policy, for Philip is what he is not so
much through his own prowess as through your own
indifference.</p>

<p>As to the plan of action to be initiated, I say that we
must inaugurate it by providing fifty triremes, also the
cavalry and transports and boats needed for the fleet.
Thus we should be fully prepared to cope with the sudden
excursions of Philip to ThermopylÃ¦ or any other
point. Besides this naval force, you should equip an
army of 2,000 foot soldiers, of whom 500 should be
Athenians, the remainder mercenaries, together with 250
cavalry, including 50 Athenians. Lastly, we should have
an auxiliary naval contingent of ten swift galleys.</p>

<p>We are now conducting affairs farcically. For we act
neither as if we were at peace, nor as if we had entered
on a war. You enlist your soldiers not for warfare, but
for religious pageants, and for parades and processions
in the market-place. We must consolidate our resources,
embody permanent forces, not temporary levies hastily
enlisted, and we must secure winter quarters for our
troops in those islands which possess harbours and granaries
for the corn.</p>

<p>No longer, men of Athens, must you continue the mere
discussion of measures without ever executing any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
your projects. Remember that Philip sustains his
power by drawing on the resources of your own allies.</p>

<p>But by adopting my plan you will at one and the same
time deprive him of his chief sources of supply, and
place yourselves out of the reach of danger. The policy
he has hitherto pursued will be effectually thwarted. No
longer will he be able to capture your citizens, as he did
by attacking Lemnos and Imbros, or to seize your Paralus,
as he did on his descent at Marathon.</p>

<p>But, men of Athens, you spend far larger sums of
money on the splendid Panathenaic and Dionysian festivals
than on your naval and military armaments. Moreover,
those festivals are always punctually celebrated,
while your preparations for war are always behindhand.
Then, when a critical juncture arrives, we find our forces
are totally inadequate to the emergency.</p>

<p>Having larger resources than any other state, you,
Athenians, have never adequately availed yourselves of
them. You never anticipate the movements of Philip,
but simply drift after him, sending forces to ThermopylÃ¦
if you hear he is there, or to any other quarter
where he may happen to be. Such policy might formerly
be excused, but now it is as disgraceful as it is intolerable.
Are we to wait for Philip's aggressiveness to
cease? It never will do so unless we resist it. Shall we
not assume the offensive and descend on his coast with
some of our forces?</p>

<p>Nothing will result from mere oratory and from
mutual recrimination among ourselves. My own conviction
is that Philip is encouraged by our inertia, and
that he is carried away by his own successes, but that he
has no fixed plan of action that can be guessed by foolish
chatterers. Men of Athens, let us for the future abandon
such an attitude, and let us bear in mind that we must
depend not on the help of others, but on ourselves alone.
Unless we go to attack Philip where he is, Philip will
come to attack us where we are.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;Beware the Guile of Philip</i></h4>

<p>Nothing, men of Athens, is done as a sequel to the
speeches which are delivered and approved concerning
the outrageous proceedings of Philip. You are earnest
in discussion; he is earnest in action. If we are to be
complacently content because we employ the better arguments,
well and good; but if we are successfully to resist
this formidable and increasing power, we must be prepared
to entertain advice that is salutary, however unpalatable,
rather than counsel which is easy and pleasant.</p>

<p>If you give me any credit for clear perception, I beg
you to attend to what I plead. After subduing ThermopylÃ¦
and the Phocians, Philip quickly apprehended
that you could not be induced by any selfish considerations
to abandon other Greek states to him. The Thebans,
Messenians, and Argives he lured by bribes. But
he knew how, in the past, your predecessors scorned the
overtures of his ancestor, Alexander of Macedon, sent
by Mardonius the Persian to induce the Athenians to
betray the rest of the Greeks. It was not so with the
Argives and the Thebans, and thus Philip calculates that
their successors will care nothing for the interests of the
Greeks generally. So he favours them, but not you.</p>

<p>Everything demonstrates Philip's animosity against
Athens. He is instinctively aware that you are conscious
of his plots against you, and ascribes to you a feeling of
hatred against him. Eager to be beforehand with us, he
continues to negotiate with Thebans and Peloponnesians,
assuming that they may be beguiled with ease.</p>

<p>I call to mind how I addressed the Messenians and the
Argives, reminding them how Philip had dishonourably
given certain of their territories to the Olynthians.
Would the Olynthians then have listened to any disparagements
of Philip? Assuredly not. Yet they were
soon shamefully betrayed and cheated by him. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
unsafe for commonwealths to place confidence in despots.
In like manner were the Thessalians deceived
when he had ejected their tyrants and had restored to
them Nicasa and Magnesia, for he instituted the new
tyranny of the Decemvirate. Philip is equally ready
with gifts and promises on the one hand, and with fraud
and deceit on the other.</p>

<p>"By Jupiter," said I to those auditors, "the only infallible
defence of democracies against despots is the
absolute refusal of all confidence in them. Always to
mistrust them is the only safeguard. What is it that you
seek to secure? Liberty? Then do you not perceive
that the very titles worn by Philip prove him to be adverse
to this? For every king and tyrant is an enemy to
freedom and an opponent to laws."</p>

<p>But though my speeches and those of other emissaries
were received with vociferous applause, all the same
those who thus manifested profound approbation will
never be able to resist the blandishments and overtures
of Philip. It may well be so with those other Greeks.
But you, O Athenians, surely should understand your
own interests better. For otherwise irreparable disaster
must ensue.</p>

<p>In justice, men of Athens, you should summon the
men who communicated to you the promises which induced
you to consent to peace. Their statements misled
us; otherwise, neither would I have gone as ambassador,
nor would you have ceased hostilities. Also, you should
call those who, after my return from my second embassy,
contradicted my report. I then protested against the
abandonment of ThermopylÃ¦ and of the Phocians.</p>

<p>They ridiculed me as a water-drinker, and they persuaded
you that Philip would cede to you Oropus and
EubÅ“a in exchange for Amphipolis, and also that he
would humble the Thebans and at his own charges cut
through the Chersonese. Your anger will be excited in
due time when you realise what you have hitherto disregarded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
namely, that these projects on the part of
Philip are devised against Athens.</p>

<p>Though all know it only too well, let me remind you
who it was, even Ã†schines himself, who induced you by
his persuasion to abandon ThermopylÃ¦ and Phocis. By
possessing control over these, Philip now commands also
the road to Attica and Peloponnesus.</p>

<p>Hence the present situation is this, that you must now
consider, not distant affairs, but the means of defending
your homes and of conducting a war in Attica, that war
having become inevitable through those events, grievous
though it will be to every citizen when it begins. May
the gods grant that the worst fears be not fully confirmed!</p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;Athens Must Head the War</i></h4>

<p>Various circumstances, men of Athens, have reduced
our affairs to the worst possible state, this lamentable
crisis being due mainly to the specious orators who seek
rather to please you than wisely to guide you. Flattery
has generated perilous complacency, and now the position
is one of extreme danger. I am willing either to
preserve silence, or to speak frankly, according to your
disposition. Yet all may be repaired if you awaken to
your duty, for Philip has not conquered you; you have
simply made no real effort against him.</p>

<p>Strange to say, while Philip is actually seizing cities
and appropriating various portions of our territory, some
among us affirm that there is really no war. Thus, caution
is needed in speech, for those who suggest defensive
measures may afterwards be indicted for causing
hostilities. Now, let those who maintain that we are at
peace propose a resolution for suitable plans. But if you
are invaded by an armed aggressor, who pretends to be
at peace with you, what can you do but initiate measures
of defence?</p>

<p>Both sides may profess to be at peace, and I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
demur; but it is madness to style that a condition of
peace which allows Philip to subjugate all other states
and then to assail you last of all. His method of proceeding
is to prepare to attack you, while securing immunity
from the danger of being attacked by you.</p>

<p>If we wait for him to declare war, we wait in vain.
For he will treat us as he did the Olynthians and the
Phocians. Professing to be their ally, he appropriated
territories belonging to them. Do you imagine he would
declare war against you before commencing operations
of encroachment? Never, so long as he knows that you
are willing to be deceived.</p>

<p>By a series of operations he has been infringing the
peace: by his attempt to seize Megara, by his intervention
in EubÅ“a, by his excursion into Thrace. I reckon
that the virtual beginnings of hostilities must be dated
from the day that he completed the subjugation of the
Thracians. From your other orators I differ in deeming
any discussion irrelevant respecting the Chersonese or
Byzantium. Aid these, indeed; but let the safety of all
Greece alike be the subject of your deliberations.</p>

<p>What I would emphasise is that to Philip have been
conceded liberties of encroachment and aggression, by
you first of all, such as in former days were always contested
by war. He has attacked and enslaved city after
city of the Greeks. You Athenians were for seventy-three
years the supreme leaders in Hellas, as were the
Spartans for twenty-nine years. Then after the battle
of Leuctra the Thebans acquired paramount influence.
But neither you nor these others ever arrogated the right
to act according to your pleasure.</p>

<p>If you appeared to act superciliously towards any
state, all the other states sided with that one which was
aggrieved. Yet all the errors committed by our predecessors
and by those of the Spartans during the whole of
that century were trivial compared with the wrongs perpetrated
by Philip during these thirteen years. Cruel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
has been his destruction of Olynthus, of Methone, of
Apollonia, and of thirty-two cities on the borders of
Thrace, and also the extermination of the Phocians.
And now he domineers ruthlessly over Thessaly and
EubÅ“a. Yet all we Greeks of various nationalities are
in so abjectly miserable a condition that, instead of arranging
embassies and declaring our indignation, we
entrench ourselves in isolation in our several cities.</p>

<p>It must be reflected that when wrongs were inflicted
by other states, by us or the Spartans, these faults were
at any rate committed by genuine sons of Greece. How
much more hateful is the offence when perpetrated
against a household by a slave or an alien than by a son
or other member of the family! But Philip is not only
no son of Hellas; he is not even a reputable barbarian,
but only a vile fellow of Macedon, a country from which
formerly even a respectable slave could not be purchased!</p>

<p>What is lacking to his unspeakable arrogance? Does
he not assemble the Pythian games, command ThermopylÃ¦,
garrison the passes, secure prior access to the
oracle at Delphi, and dictate the form of government for
Thessaly? All this the Greeks look upon with toleration;
they seem to regard it as they would some tempest,
each hoping it will fall on someone else. We are all
passive and despondent, mutually distrusting each other
instead of the common foe.</p>

<p>How different the noble spirit of former days! How
different that old passion for liberty which is now superseded
by the love of servitude! Then corruption was so
deeply detested that there was no pardon for the guilt
of bribery. Now venality is laughed at and bribery goes
unpunished. In ships, men, equipment, and revenues our
resources are larger than ever before, but corruption
neutralises them all.</p>

<p>But preparations for war are not sufficient. You must
not only be ready to encounter the foes without, but must
punish those who among you are the creatures of Philip,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
like those who caused the ruin of Olynthus by betraying
the cavalry and by securing the banishment of Apollonides.
Similar treachery brought about the downfall of
other cities. The same fate may befall us. What, then,
must be done?</p>

<p>When we have done all that is needful for our own
defence, let us next send our emissaries to all the other
states with the intelligence that we are ready. If you
imagine that others will save Greece while you avoid the
conflict, you cherish a fatal delusion. This enterprise
devolves on you; you inherit it from your ancestors.</p>

<h4><i>IV.&mdash;Exterminate the Traitors!</i></h4>

<p>Men of Athens, your chief misfortune is that, though
for the passing moment you heed important news, you
speedily scatter and forget what you have just heard.
You have become fully acquainted with the doings of
Philip, and you well know how great is his ambition; and
yet, so profound has been our indifference that we have
earned the contempt of several other states, which now
prefer to undertake their defence separately rather than
in alliance with us.</p>

<p>You must become more deeply convinced than you
have been hitherto that our destruction is the supreme
anxiety of Philip. The special object of his hatred is
your democratic constitution. Our mode of procedure
is a mockery, for we are always behind in the execution
of our schemes. You must form a permanent army with
a regular organisation, and with funds sufficient for its
maintenance.</p>

<p>Most of all, money is needed to meet coming requirements.
There was a time when money was forthcoming
and everything necessary was performed. Why do we
now decline to do our duty? In a time of peril to the commonwealth
the affluent should freely contribute of their
possessions for the welfare of the country; but each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
class has its obligations to the state and should observe
them.</p>

<p>Many and inveterate are the causes of our present
difficulties. You, O Athenians, have surrendered the
august position which your predecessors bequeathed you,
and have indolently permitted a stranger to usurp it.
The present crisis involves peril for all the states, but
to Athens most of all; and that not so much on account
of Philip's schemes of conquest, as of your neglect.</p>

<p>How is it, Athenians, that none affirm concerning
Philip that he is guilty of aggression, even while he is
seizing cities, while those who advise resistance are indicated
as inciting to war? The reason is that those who
have been corrupted believe that if you do resist him you
will overcome him, and they can no longer secure the
reward of treachery.</p>

<p>Remember what you have at stake. Should you fall
under the dominion of Philip, he will show you no pity,
for his desire is not merely to subdue Athens, but to
destroy it. The struggle will be to the death; therefore,
those who would sell the country to him you must exterminate
without scruple. This is the only city where
such treacherous citizens can dare to speak in his favour.
Only here may a man safely accept a bribe and openly
address the people.</p>

<h3>English Traits</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>In 1847 Emerson (see Vol. XIII, p. 339) made his second visit
to England, this time on a lecturing tour. An outcome of the
visit was "English Traits," which was first published in 1856.
"I leave England," he wrote on his return home, "with an increased
respect for the Englishman. His stuff or substance
seems to be the best in the world." "English Traits" deals
with a series of definite subjects which do not admit of much
philosophic digression, and there is, therefore, an absence of
the flashes of spiritual and poetic insight which gave Emerson
his charm.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;The Anchorage of Britain</i></h4>

<p>I did not go very willingly to England. I am not a
good traveller, nor have I found that long journeys yield
a fair share of reasonable hours. I find a sea-life an
acquired taste, like that for tomatoes and olives. The
sea is masculine, the type of active strength. Look what
egg-shells are drifting all over it, each one filled with men
in ecstasies of terror alternating with cockney conceit, as
it is rough or smooth. But to the geologist the sea is the
only firmament; it is the land that is in perpetual flux and
change. It has been said that the King of England would
consult his dignity by giving audience to foreign ambassadors
in the cabin of a man-of-war; and I think the
white path of an Atlantic ship is the right avenue to the
palace-front of this seafaring people.</p>

<p>England is a garden. Under an ash-coloured sky, the
fields have been combed and rolled till they appear to have
been finished with a pencil instead of a plough. Rivers,
hills, valleys, the sea itself, feel the hand of a master.
The problem of the traveller landing in Liverpool is, Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
England is England? What are the elements of that
power which the English hold over other nations? If
there be one test of national genius universally accepted,
it is success; and if there be one successful country in the
universe that country is England.</p>

<p>The culture of the day, the thoughts and aims of men,
are English thoughts and aims. A nation considerable
for a thousand years has in the last centuries obtained
the ascendant, and stamped the knowledge, activity, and
power of mankind with its impress.</p>

<p>The territory has a singular perfection. Neither hot
nor cold, there is no hour in the whole year when one
cannot work. The only drawback to industrial conveniency
is the darkness of the sky. The night and day
are too nearly of a colour.</p>

<p>England resembles a ship in shape, and, if it were one,
its best admiral could not have anchored it in a more
judicious or effective position. The shop-keeping nation,
to use a shop word, has a good stand. It is anchored at
the side of Europe, and right in the heart of the modern
world.</p>

<p>In variety of surface Britain is a miniature of Europe,
as if Nature had given it an artificial completeness. It is
as if Nature had held counsel with herself and said: "My
Romans are gone. To build my new empire I will choose
a rude race, all masculine, with brutish strength. Sharp
and temperate northern breezes shall blow to keep them
alive and alert. The sea shall disjoin the people from
others and knit them by a fierce nationality. Long time
will I keep them on their feet, by poverty, border-wars,
seafaring, sea-risks, and stimulus of gain." A singular
coincidence to this geographic centrality is the spiritual
centrality which Emanuel Swedenborg ascribes to the
people: "The English nation are in the centre of all
Christians, because they have an interior intellectual light.
This light they derive from the liberty of speaking and
writing, and thereby of thinking."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;Racial Characteristics</i></h4>

<p>The British Empire is reckoned to contain a fifth of
the population of the globe; but what makes the British
census proper important is the quality of the units that
compose it. They are free, forcible men in a country
where life has reached the greatest value. They have
sound bodies and supreme endurance in war and in
labour. They have assimilating force, since they are
imitated by their foreign subjects; and they are still aggressive
and propagandist, enlarging the dominion of
their arts and liberty.</p>

<p>The English composite character betrays a mixed
origin. Everything English is a fusion of distant and
antagonistic elements. The language is mixed; the currents
of thought are counter; contemplation and practical
skill; active intellect and dead conservatism; world-wide
enterprise and devoted use and wont; a country of extremes&mdash;nothing
in it can be praised without damning
exceptions, and nothing denounced without salvos of
cordial praise.</p>

<p>The sources from which tradition derives its stock are
mainly three: First, the Celtic&mdash;a people of hidden and
precarious genius; second, the Germans, a people about
whom, in the old empire, the rumour ran there was never
any that meddled with them that repented it not; and,
third, the Norsemen and the children out of France.
Twenty thousand thieves landed at Hastings. These
founders of the House of Lords were greedy and
ferocious dragoons, sons of greedy and ferocious pirates.
Such, however, is the illusion of antiquity and wealth that
decent and dignified men now existing actually boast their
descent from these filthy thieves.</p>

<p>As soon as this land, thus geographically posted, got a
hardy people into it, they could not help becoming the
sailors and factors of the world. The English, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
present day, have great vigour of body. They are round,
ruddy, and handsome, with a tendency to stout and
powerful frames. It is the fault of their forms that they
grow stocky, but in all ages they are a handsome race,
and please by an expression blending good nature, valour,
refinement, and an uncorrupt youth in the face of manhood.</p>

<p>The English are rather manly than warlike. They delight
in the antagonism which combines in one person the
extremes of courage and tenderness. Nelson, dying at
Trafalgar, says, "Kiss me, Hardy," and turns to sleep.
Even for their highwaymen this virtue is claimed, and
Robin Hood is the gentlest thief. But they know where
their war-dogs lie, and Cromwell, Blake, Marlborough,
Nelson, and Wellington are not to be trifled with.</p>

<p>They have vigorous health and last well into middle
and old age. They have more constitutional energy than
any other people. They box, run, shoot, ride, row, and
sail from Pole to Pole. They are the most voracious
people of prey that have ever existed, and they have written
the game-books of all countries.</p>

<p>These Saxons are the hands of mankind&mdash;the world's
wealth-makers. They have that temperament which resists
every means employed to make its possessor subservient
to others. The English game is main force to main
force, the planting of foot to foot, fair play and an open
field&mdash;a rough tug without trick or dodging till one or
both comes to pieces. They hate craft and subtlety; and
when they have pounded each other to a poultice they will
shake hands and be friends for the remainder of their
lives.</p>

<p>Their realistic logic of coupling means to ends has
given them the leadership of the modern world. Montesquieu
said: "No people have true commonsense but
those who are born in England." This commonsense is
a perception of laws that cannot be stated, or that are
learned only by practice, with allowance for friction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
The bias of the nation is a passion for utility. They are
heavy at the fine arts, but adroit at the coarse. The
Frenchman invented the ruffle, the Englishman added the
shirt. They think him the best-dressed man whose dress
is so fit for his use that you cannot notice or remember
to describe it.</p>

<p>In war the Englishman looks to his means; but, conscious
that no better race of men exists, they rely most
on the simplest means. They fundamentally believe that
the best stratagem in naval war is to bring your ship
alongside of the enemy's ship, and bring all your guns to
bear on him until you or he go to the bottom. This is the
old fashion which never goes out of fashion.</p>

<p>Tacitus said of the Germans: "Powerful only in sudden
efforts, they are impatient of toil and labour." This
highly destined race, if it had not somewhere added the
chamber of patience to its brain, would not have built
London. I know not from which of the tribes and temperaments
that went to the composition of the people this
tenacity was supplied, but they clinch every nail they
drive. "To show capacity," a Frenchman described as
the end of speech in a debate. "No," said an Englishman,
"but to advance the business."</p>

<p>The nation sits in the immense city they have builded&mdash;a
London extended into every man's mind. The
modern world is theirs. They have made and make it
day by day. In every path of practical ability they have
gone even with the best. There is no department of
literature, of science, or of useful art in which they have
not produced a first-rate book. It is England whose
opinion is waited for. English trade exists to make well
everything which is ill-made elsewhere. Steam is almost
an Englishman.</p>

<p>One secret of the power of this people is their mutual
good understanding. Not only good minds are born
among them, but all the people have good minds. An
electric touch by any of their national ideas melts them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
into one family. The chancellor carries England on his
mace, the midshipman at the point of his dirk, the smith
on his hammer, the cook in the bowl of his spoon, and
the sailor times his oars to "God save the King!"</p>

<p>I find the Englishman to be him of all men who stands
firmest in his shoes. The one thing the English value is
pluck. The word is not beautiful, but on the quality
they signify by it the nation is unanimous. The cabmen
have it, the merchants have it, the bishops have it, the
women have it, the journals have it. They require you
to dare to be of your own opinion, and they hate the
practical cowards who cannot answer directly Yes or No.</p>

<p>Their vigour appears in the incuriosity and stony neglect
each of the other. Each man walks, eats, drinks,
shaves, dresses, gesticulates, and in every manner acts and
suffers, without reference to the bystanders&mdash;he is really
occupied with his own affairs, and does not think of them.
In short, every one of these islanders is an island himself,
safe, tranquil, incommunicable.</p>

<p>Born in a harsh and wet climate, which keeps him indoors
whenever he is at rest, and, being of an affectionate
and loyal temper, the Englishman dearly loves his home.
If he is rich he builds a hall, and brings to it trophies of
the adventures and exploits of the family, till it becomes
a museum of heirlooms. England produces, under
favourable conditions of ease and culture, the finest
women in the world. Nothing can be more delicate without
being fantastical, than the courtship and mutual carriage
of the sexes. Domesticity is the taproot which
enables the nation to branch wide and high. In an aristocratical
country like England, not the trial by jury, but
the dinner is the capital institution. It is the mode of
doing honour to a stranger to ask him to eat.</p>

<p>The practical power of the English rests on their sincerity.
Alfred, whom the affection of the nation makes
the type of their race, is called by a writer at the Norman
Conquest, the "truth-speaker." The phrase of the lowest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
of the people is "honour-bright," and their praise,
"his word is as good as his bond." They confide in each
other&mdash;English believes in English. Madame de StaÃ«l
says that the English irritated Napoleon mainly because
they have found out how to unite success with honesty.
The ruling passion of an Englishman is a terror of
humbug.</p>

<p>The English race are reputed morose. They have enjoyed
a reputation for taciturnity for six or seven hundred
years. Cold, repressive manners prevail, and there is a
wooden deadness in certain Englishmen which surpasses
all other countrymen. In the power of saying rude truth
no men rival them. They are proud and private, and even
if disposed to recreation will avoid an open garden. They
are full of coarse strength, butcher's meat, and sound
sleep. They are good lovers, good haters, slow but obstinate
admirers, and very much steeped in their temperament,
like men hardly awaked from deep sleep which
they enjoy.</p>

<p>The English have a mild aspect, and ringing, cheerful
voice. Of absolute stoutness of spirit, no nation has
more or better examples. They are good at storming redoubts,
at boarding frigates, at dying in the last ditch, or
any desperate service which has daylight and honour in
it. They stoutly carry into every nook and corner of
the earth their turbulent sense of inquiry, leaving no lie
uncontradicted, no pretension unexamined.</p>

<p>They are very conscious of their advantageous position
in history. I suppose that all men of English blood in
America, Europe, or Asia, have a secret feeling of joy
that they are not Frenchmen. They only are not foreigners.
In short, I am afraid that the English nature is so
rank and aggressive as to be a little incompatible with any
other. The world is not wide enough for two. More
intellectual than other races, when they live with other
races they do not take their language, but bestow their
own. They subsidise other nations, and are not subsidised.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
They proselytise and are not proselytised. They
assimilate other nations to themselves and are not assimilated.</p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;Wealth, Aristocracy, and Religion</i></h4>

<p>There is no country in which so absolute a homage is
paid to wealth. There is a mixture of religion in it. The
Englishman esteems wealth a final certificate. He believes
that every man has himself to thank if he does not
mend his condition. To pay their debts is their national
point of honour. The British armies are solvent, and pay
for what they take. The British empire is solvent. It is
their maxim that the weight of taxes must be calculated
not by what is taken but by what is left. They say without
shame: "I cannot afford it." Such is their enterprise,
that there is enough wealth in England to support the
entire population in idleness one year. The proudest result
of this creation of wealth is that great and refined
forces are put at the disposal of the private citizen, and
in the social world the Englishman to-day has the best
lot. I much prefer the condition of an English gentleman
of the better class to that of any potentate in
Europe.</p>

<p>The feudal character of the English state, now that it
is getting obsolete, glares a little in contrast with democratic
tendencies. But the frame of society is aristocratic.
Every man who becomes rich buys land, and does what
he can to fortify the nobility, into which he hopes to rise.
The taste of the people is conservative. They are proud
of the castles, language, and symbols of chivalry. English
history is aristocracy with the doors open. Who has
courage and faculty, let him come in.</p>

<p>All nobility in its beginnings was somebody's natural
superiority. The things these English have done were
not done without peril of life, nor without wisdom of
conduct, and the first hands, it may be presumed, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
often challenged to show their right to their honours, or
yield them to better men.</p>

<p>Comity, social talent, and fine manners no doubt have
had their part also. The lawyer, the farmer, the silk
mercer lies <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">perdu</i> under the coronet, and winks to the
antiquary to say nothing. They were nobody's sons who
did some piece of work at a nice moment.</p>

<p>The English names are excellent&mdash;they spread an atmosphere
of legendary melody over the land. Older than
epics and histories, which clothe a nation, this undershirt
sits close to the body. What stores of primitive and
savage observation it infolds! Cambridge is the bridge
of the Cam; Sheffield the field of the river Sheaf; Leicester
the camp of Lear; Waltham is Strong Town; Radcliffe
is Red Cliff, and so on&mdash;a sincerity and use in
naming very striking to an American, whose country is
whitewashed all over with unmeaning names, the cast-off
clothes of the country from which the emigrants came,
or named at a pinch from a psalm tune.</p>

<p>In seeing old castles and cathedrals I sometimes say:
"This was built by another and a better race than any
that now look on it." Their architecture still glows with
faith in immortality. Good churches are not built by bad
men; at least, there must be probity and enthusiasm somewhere
in society.</p>

<p>England felt the full heat of the Christianity which
fermented Europe, and, like the chemistry of fire, drew
a firm line between barbarism and culture. When the
Saxon instinct had secured a service in the vernacular
tongue the Church was the tutor and university of the
people.</p>

<p>Now the Anglican Church is marked by the grace and
good sense of its forms; by the manly grace of its clergy.
The gospel it preaches is "By taste are ye saved." The
religion of England is part of good breeding. When you
see on the Continent the well-dressed Englishman come
into his ambassador's chapel and put his face for silent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
prayer into his well-brushed hat, you cannot help feeling
how much national pride prays with him, and the religion
of a gentleman.</p>

<p>At this moment the Church is much to be pitied. If a
bishop meets an intelligent gentleman and reads fatal interrogation
in his eyes, he has no resource but to take
wine with him.</p>

<p>But the religion of England&mdash;is it the Established
Church? No. Is it the sects? No. Where dwells the
religion? Tell me first where dwells electricity, or motion,
or thought? They do not dwell or stay at all. Electricity
is passing, glancing, gesticular; it is a traveller, a
newness, a secret. Yet, if religion be the doing of all
good, and for its sake the suffering of all evil, that divine
secret has existed in England from the days of Alfred to
the days of Florence Nightingale, and in thousands who
have no fame.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="ch_118"><a name="Representative_Men" id="Representative_Men">Representative Men</a></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Some of the lectures delivered by Emerson during his lecturing
tour in England were published in 1850 under the title
of "Representative Men," and the main trend of their thought
and opinion is here followed in Emerson's own words. It will
be noted that the use of the term "sceptic," as applied to Montaigne,
is not the ordinary use of the word, but signifies a person
spontaneously given to free inquiry rather than aggressive
disbelief. The estimate of Napoleon is original. In "Representative
Men" Emerson is much more consecutive in his
thought than is customary with him. His pearls are as plentiful
here as elsewhere, but they are not scattered disconnectedly.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>Plato</i></h4>

<p>Among secular books, Plato only is entitled to Omar's
fanatical compliment to the Koran: "Burn all books,
for their value is in this book." Out of Plato come all
things that are still written and debated among men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
thought. Plato is philosophy, and philosophy Plato. No
wife, no children had he, but the thinkers of all civilised
nations are his posterity, and are tinged with his mind.</p>

<p>Great geniuses have the shortest biographies. They
lived in their writings, and so their house and street life
is commonplace. Their cousins can tell you nothing about
them. Plato, especially, has no external biography.</p>

<p>Plato stands between the truth and every man's mind,
and has almost impressed language and the primary
forms of thought with his name and seal.</p>

<p>The first period of a nation, as of an individual, is the
period of unconscious strength. Children cry, scream,
and stamp with fury, unable to express their desires. As
soon as they can speak and tell their wants they become
gentle. With nations he is as a god to them who can
rightly divide and define. This defining is philosophy.
Philosophy is the account which the human mind gives to
itself of the constitution of the world.</p>

<p>Two cardinal facts lie ever at the base of thought:
Unity and Variety&mdash;oneness and otherness.</p>

<p>To this partiality the history of nations corresponds.
The country of unity, faithful to the idea of a deaf, unimplorable,
immense fate, is Asia; on the other side, the
genius of Europe is active and creative. If the East loves
infinity, the West delights in boundaries. Plato came to
join and enhance the energy of each. The excellence of
Europe and Asia is in his brain. No man ever more fully
acknowledged the Ineffable; but having paid his homage,
as for the human race, to the illimitable, he then stood
erect, and for the human race affirmed: "And yet things
are knowable!" Full of the genius of Europe, he said
"Culture," he said "Nature," but he failed not to add,
"There is also the divine."</p>

<p>This leads us to the central figure which he has established
in his academy. Socrates and Plato are the double-star
which the most powerful instrument will not entirely
separate. Socrates, in his traits and genius, is the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
example of that synthesis which constitutes Plato's extraordinary
power.</p>

<p>Socrates, a man of humble stem, and a personal homeliness
so remarkable as to be a cause of wit in others, was
a cool fellow, with a knowledge of his man, be he whom
he might whom he talked with, which laid the companion
open to certain defeat in debate; and in debate he immoderately
delighted. He was what in our country people
call "an old one." This hard-headed humorist, whose
drollery diverted the young patricians, turns out in the
sequel to have a probity as invincible as his logic, and to
be, under cover of this play, enthusiastic in his religion.
When accused before the judges, he affirmed the immortality
of the soul and a future reward and punishment,
and, refusing to recant, was condemned to die; he entered
the prison and took away all ignominy from the place. The
fame of this prison, the fame of the discourses there,
and the drinking of the hemlock, are one of the most
precious passages in the history of the world.</p>

<p>The rare coincidence in one ugly body of the droll
and the martyr, the keen street debater with the sweetest
saint known to any history at that time, had forcibly
struck the mind of Plato, and the figure of Socrates
placed itself in the foreground of the scene as the fittest
dispenser of the intellectual treasures he had to communicate.</p>

<p>It remains to say that the defect of Plato is that he is
literary, and never otherwise. His writings have not the
vital authority which the screams of prophets and the
sermons of unlettered Arabs and Jews possess.</p>

<p>And he had not a system. The acutest German, the
lovingest disciple could never tell what Platonism was.
No power of genius has ever yet had the smallest success
in explaining existence. The perfect enigma remains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Montaigne</i></h4>

<p>The philosophers affirm disdainfully the superiority
of ideas. To men of this world the man of ideas appears
out of his reason. The abstractionist and the materialist
thus mutually exasperating each other, there arises
a third party to occupy the middle ground between the
two, the sceptic. He labours to be the beam of the balance.
There is so much to say on all sides. This is the
position occupied by Montaigne.</p>

<p>In 1571, on the death of his father, he retired from the
practice of the law, at Bordeaux, and settled himself
on his estate. Downright and plain dealing, and abhorring
to be deceived or to deceive, he was esteemed
in the country for his sense and probity. In the civil
wars of the League, which converted every house into
a fort, Montaigne kept his gates open, and his house
without defence. All parties freely came and went, his
courage and honor being universally esteemed.</p>

<p>Montaigne is the frankest and honestest of all writers.
The essays are an entertaining soliloquy on every random
topic that comes into his head, treating everything
without ceremony, yet with masculine sense. I know
not anywhere the book that seems less written. It is
the language of conversation transferred to a book.
Montaigne talks with shrewdness, knows the world, and
books, and himself; never shrieks, or protests, or prays.
He keeps the plain; he rarely mounts or sinks; he likes
to feel solid ground and the stones underneath.</p>

<p>We are natural believers. We are persuaded that a
thread runs through all things, and all worlds are strung
on it as beads. But though we reject a sour, dumpish
unbelief, to the sceptical class, which Montaigne represents,
every man at some time belongs. The ground occupied
by the sceptic is the vestibule of the temple. The
interrogation of custom at all points is an inevitable stage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
in the growth of every superior mind. It stands in the
mind of the wise sceptic that our life in this world is not
quite so easy of interpretation as churches and school
books say. He does not wish to take ground against these
benevolences, but he says: "There are doubts. Shall
we, because good nature inclines us to virtue's side, say,
'There are no doubts&mdash;and lie for the right?' Is not the
satisfaction of the doubts essential to all manliness?"</p>

<p>I may play with the miscellany of facts, and take
those superficial views which we call scepticism; but
I know they will presently appear to me in that order
which makes scepticism impossible. For the world is
saturated with deity and law. Things seem to tend
downward, to justify despondency, to promote rogues,
to defeat the just; but by knaves as by martyrs the just
cause is carried forward, and general ends are somewhat
answered. The world-spirit is a good swimmer,
and storms and waves cannot drown him. Through the
years and the centuries, through evil agents, through
toys and atoms, a great and beneficent tendency irresistibly
streams. So let a man learn to look for the permanent
in the mutable and fleeting; let him learn to
bear the disappearance of things he was wont to reverence
without losing his reverence.</p>

<h4><i>Shakespeare</i></h4>

<p>Shakespeare is the only biographer of Shakespeare.
So far from Shakespeare being the least known, he is
the one person in all modern history known to us. What
point of morals, of manners, of economy, of philosophy,
of taste, of conduct of life has he not settled? What
district of man's work has he not remembered? What
king has he not taught statecraft? What maiden has not
found him finer than her delicacy? What lover has he
not outloved?</p>

<p>Some able and appreciating critics think no criticism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
on Shakespeare valuable that does not rest purely on
the dramatic merit; that he is falsely judged as poet
and philosopher. I think as highly as these critics of his
dramatic merit, but still think it secondary. He was a full
man who liked to talk; a brain exhaling thoughts and images,
which, seeking vent, found the drama next at hand.</p>

<p>Shakespeare is as much out of the category of
eminent authors as he is out of the crowd. He is inconceivably
wise; the others, conceivably. With this
wisdom of life is the equal endowment of imaginative
and lyric power. An omnipresent humanity co-ordinates
all his faculties. He has no peculiarity, no importunate
topic, but all is duly given. No mannerist is he; he
has no discoverable egotism&mdash;the great he tells greatly,
the small subordinately. He is wise without emphasis
or assertion; he is strong as Nature is strong, who
lifts the land into mountain slopes without effort, and
by the same rule as she floats a bubble in the air, and
likes as well to do the one as the other. This power of
transferring the inmost truth of things into music and
verse makes him the type of the poet.</p>

<p>One royal trait that belongs to Shakespeare is his
cheerfulness. He delights in the world, in man, in
woman, for the lovely light that sparkles from them.
Beauty, the spirit of joy, he sheds over the universe. If
he appeared in any company of human souls, who would
not march in his troop? He touches nothing that does
not borrow health and longevity from his festal style.
He was master of the revels to mankind.</p>

<h4><i>Napoleon</i></h4>

<p>Among the eminent persons of the nineteenth century,
Bonaparte owes his predominance to the fidelity with
which he expresses the aim of the masses of active and
cultivated men. If Napoleon was Europe, it was because
the people whom he swayed were little Napoleons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
He is the representative of the class of industry and
skill. "God has granted," says the Koran, "to every
people a prophet in its own tongue." Paris, London,
and New York, the spirit of commerce, of money, of
material power, were also to have their prophet&mdash;and
Bonaparte was qualified and sent. He was the idol of
common men because he, in transcendent degree, had
the qualities and powers of common men. He came
to his own and they received him.</p>

<p>An Italian proverb declares that if you would succeed
you must not be too good. Napoleon renounced,
once for all, sentiments and affections, and helped himself
with his hands and his head. The art of war was
the game in which he exerted his arithmetic. He had a
directness of action never before combined with so much
comprehension. History is full of the imbecility of
kings and governors. They are a class of persons to
be much pitied, for they know not what they should do.
But Napoleon understood his business. He knew what
to do, and he flew to his mark. He put out all his
strength; he risked everything; he spared nothing; he
went to the edge of his possibilities.</p>

<p>This vigour was guarded and tempered by the coldest
prudence and punctuality. His very attack was never
the inspiration of courage, but the result of calculation.
The necessity of his position required a hospitality to
every sort of talent, and his feeling went along with
this policy. In fact, every species of merit was sought
and advanced under his government. Seventeen men
in his time were raised from common soldiers to the rank
of king, marshal, duke, or general. I call Napoleon the
agent or attorney of the middle class of modern society.</p>

<p>His life was an experiment, under the most favourable
conditions, of the powers of intellect without conscience.
All passed away, like the smoke of his artillery,
and left no trace. He did all that in him lay to
live and thrive without moral principle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Goethe</i></h4>

<p>I find a provision in the constitution of the world for
the writer or secretary who is to report the doings of
the miraculous spirit of life that everywhere throbs and
works. Nature will be reported. All things are engaged
in writing their history. The planet goes attended
by its shadow. The air is full of sounds, the sky of
tokens; the ground is all memoranda and signatures.</p>

<p>Society has really no graver interest than the well-being
of the literary class. Still, the writer does not
stand with us on any commanding ground. I think this
to be his own fault. There have been times when he was
a sacred person; he wrote Bibles; the first hymns; the
codes; the epics; tragic songs; Sibylline verses; ChaldÃ¦an
oracles. Every word was true, and woke the nations to
new life. How can he be honoured when he is a sycophant
ducking to the giddy opinion of a reckless public?</p>

<p>Goethe was the philosopher of the nineteenth century
multitude, hundred-handed, Argus-eyed, able and happy
to cope with the century's rolling miscellany of facts and
sciences, and by his own versatility dispose of them with
ease; and what he says of religion, of passion, of marriage,
of manners, of property, of paper-money, of
periods of belief, of omens, of luck, of whatever else,
refuses to be forgotten.</p>

<p>What distinguishes Goethe, for French and English
readers, is an habitual reference to interior truth. But
I dare not say that Goethe ascended to the highest
grounds from which genius has spoken. He is incapable
of self-surrender to the moral sentiment. Goethe
can never be dear to men. His is a devotion to truth
for the sake of culture. But the idea of absolute eternal
truth, without reference to my own enlargement by it is
higher; and the surrender to the torrent of poetic inspiration
is higher.</p>

<h2 id="ch_126"><a name="ERASMUS" id="ERASMUS">ERASMUS</a></h2>

<h3>Familiar Colloquies</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Desiderius Erasmus, the most learned ecclesiastic of the fifteenth
century, and the friend of Luther and other reformers,
was born at Rotterdam on October 28, 1466, and died at Basel
on July 12, 1536. He was the son of a Dutchman named Gerard,
and, according to the fashion of the age, changed his family
name into its respective Latin and Greek equivalents, Desiderius
and Erasmus, meaning "desired," or "loved." Entering the
priesthood in 1492, he pursued his studies at Paris, and became
so renowned a scholar that he was, on visiting England, received
with distinction, not only at the universities, but also by the
king. For some time Erasmus settled in Italy, brilliant prospects
being held out to him at Rome; but his restless temperament
impelled him to wander again, and he came again to
England, where he associated with the most distinguished
scholars, including Dean Colet and Sir Thomas More. Perhaps
nothing in the whole range of mediÃ¦val literature made
a greater sensation immediately on its appearance, in 1521,
than the "Colloquia," or "Familiar Colloquies Concerning Men,
Manners, and Things," of Erasmus. As its title indicates, it
consists of dialogues, and its author intended it to make youths
more proficient in Latin, that language being the chief vehicle
of intercommunication in the Middle Ages. But Erasmus
claims, in his preface, that another purpose of the book is to
make better men as well as better Latinists, for he says: "If
the ancient teachers of children are commended who allured
the young with wafers, I think it ought not to be charged on
me that by the like reward I allure youths either to the elegancy
of the Latin tongue or to piety." This selection is made from
the Latin text.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>Concerning Men, Manners and Things</i></h4>

<p>Erasmus issued his first edition of the "Colloquies"
in 1521. Successive editions appeared with great rapidity.
Its popularity wherever Latin was read was immense,
but it was condemned by the Sarbonne, prohibited
in France, and devoted to the flames publicly in
Spain. The reader of its extraordinary chapters will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
not fail to comprehend that such a fate was inevitable
in the case of such a production in those times. For, as
the friend of the reformers who were "turning the world
upside down," Erasmus in this treatise penned the most
audacious, sardonic, and withering onslaught ever delivered
by any writer on ecclesiastical corruption of religion.
He never attacks religion itself, but extols and defends
it; his aim is to launch a series of terrific innuendoes
on ecclesiasticism as it had developed and as he saw
it. He satirically, and even virulently, attacks monks
and many of their habits, the whole system of cloister-life,
the festivals and pilgrimages which formed one of
the chief features of religious activity, and the grotesque
superstitions which his peculiar genius for eloquent irony
so well qualified him to caricature.</p>

<p>This great work, one of the epoch-making books of the
world, consists of sixty-two "Colloquies," of very varying
length. They treat of the most curiously diverse
topics, as may be imagined from such titles of the chapters
as "The Youth's Piety," "The Lover and the
Maiden," "The Shipwreck," "The Epithalamium of
Peter Egidius," "The Alchemist," "The Horse Cheat,"
"The Cyclops, or the Gospel Carrier," "The Assembly
or Parliament of Women," "Concerning Early Rising."</p>

<p>A sample of the style of the "Colloquies" in the more
serious sections may be taken from the one entitled "The
Religious Banquet."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nephew</span>: How unwillingly have I seen many Christians
die. Some put their trust in things not to be confided
in; others breathe out their souls in desperation,
either out of a consciousness of their lewd lives, or by
reason of scruples that have been injected into their
minds, even in their dying hours, by some indiscreet men,
die almost in despair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrysoglottus</span>: It is no wonder to find them die so,
who have spent their lives in philosophising all their lives
about ceremonies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Nephew</span>: What do you mean by ceremonies?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrysoglottus</span>: I will tell you, but with protestation
beforehand, over and over, that I do not find fault with
the rites and sacraments of the Church, but rather highly
approve of them; but I blame a wicked and superstitious
sort of people who teach people to put their confidence
in these things, omitting those things that make them
truly Christians. If you look into Christians in common,
do they not live as if the whole sum of religion
consisted in ceremonies? With how much pomp are the
ancient rites of the Church set forth in baptism? The
infant waits without the church door, the exorcism is
performed, the catechism is performed, vows are made,
Satan is abjured with all his pomps and pleasures; then
the child is anointed, signed, seasoned with salt, dipped,
a charge given to its sureties to see it well brought up;
and the oblation money being paid, they are discharged,
and by this time the child passes for a Christian, and in
some sense is so. A little time after it is anointed again,
and in time learns to confess, receive the sacrament, is
accustomed to rest on holy days, to hear divine service,
to fast sometimes, to abstain from flesh; and if he observes
all these he passes for an absolute Christian. He
marries a wife, and then comes on another sacrament;
he enters into holy orders, is anointed again and consecrated,
his habit is changed, and then to prayers.</p>

<p>Now, I approve of the doing of all this well enough,
but the doing of them more out of custom than conscience
I do not approve. But to think that nothing
else is requisite for the making of a Christian I absolutely
disapprove. For the greater part of the men in
the world trust to these things, and think they have nothing
else to do but get wealth by right or wrong, to
gratify their passions of lust, rage, malice, ambition.
And this they do till they come on their death-bed. And
then follow more ceremonies&mdash;confession upon confession
more unction still, the eucharists are administered;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
tapers, the cross, the holy water are brought in; indulgences
are procured, if they are to be had for love or
money; and orders are given for a magnificent funeral.
Now, although these things may be well enough, as they
are done in conformity to ecclesiastical customs, yet there
are some more internal impressions which have an efficacy
to fortify us against the assaults of death by filling
our hearts with joy, and helping us to go out of the world
with a Christian assurance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eusebius</span>: When I was in England I saw St. Thomas'
tomb all over bedecked with a vast number of jewels of
an immense price, besides other rich furniture, even to
admiration. I had rather that these superfluities should
be applied to charitable uses than to be reserved for
princes that shall one time or other make a booty of
them. The holy man, I am confident, would have been
better pleased to have had his tomb adorned with leaves
and flowers.... Rich men, nowadays, will have
their monuments in churches, whereas in time past they
could hardly get room for their saints there. If I were
a priest or a bishop, I would put it into the head of these
thick-skulled courtiers or merchants that if they would
atone for their sins to Almighty God they should privately
bestow their liberality on the relief of the poor.</p>

<p>A wonderful plea for peace, in shape of an exquisite
satire, is the "Colloquy" entitled "Charon." It is a
dialogue between Charon, the ghostly boatman on the
River Styx, and Genius Alastor. Its style may be gathered
from the following excerpt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charon</span>: Whither are you going so brisk, and in such
haste, Alastor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alastor</span>: O Charon, you come in the nick of time; I
was coming to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charon</span>: Well, what news do you bring?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alastor</span>: I bring a message to you and Prosperine
that you will be glad to hear. All the Furies have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
no less diligent than they have been successful in gaining
their point. There is not one foot of ground upon earth
that they have not infected with their hellish calamities,
seditions, wars, robberies, and plagues. Do you get your
boat and your oars ready; you will have such a vast multitude
of ghosts come to you anon that I am afraid you
will not be able to carry them all over yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charon</span>: I could have told you that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alastor</span>: How came you to know it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charon</span>: Ossa brought me that news about two days
ago!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alastor</span>: Nothing is more swift than that goddess.
But what makes you loitering here, having left your boat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charon</span>: My business brought me hither. I came
hither to provide myself with a good strong three-oared
boat, for my boat is so rotten and leaky with age that it
will not carry such a burden, if Ossa told me true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alastor</span>: What was it that Ossa told you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charon</span>: That the three monarchs of the world were
bent upon each other's destruction with a mortal hatred,
and that no part of Christendom was free from the rage
of war; for these three have drawn in all the rest to be
engaged in the war with them. They are all so haughty
that not one of them will in the least submit to the other.
Nor are the Danes, the Poles, the Scots, nor the Turks
at quiet, but are preparing to make dreadful havoc.
The plague rages everywhere: in Spain, Britain, Italy,
France; and, more than all, there is a new fire sprung
out of the variety of opinions, which has so corrupted
the minds of all men that there is no such thing as sincere
friendship anywhere; but brother is at enmity with
brother, and husband and wife cannot agree. And it is
to be hoped that this distraction will be a glorious destruction
of mankind, if these controversies, that are
now managed by the tongue and pen, come once to be
decided by arms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alastor</span>: All that fame has told you is true; for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
myself, having been a constant companion of the Furies,
have with these eyes seen more than all this, and that
they never at any time have approved themselves more
worthy of their name than now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charon</span>: But there is danger lest some good spirit
should start up and of a sudden exhort them to peace.
And men's minds are variable, for I have heard that
among the living there is one Polygraphus who is continually,
by his writing, inveighing against wars, and exhorting
to peace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alastor</span>: Ay, ay, but he has a long time been talking
to the deaf. He once wrote a sort of hue and cry after
peace, that was banished or driven away; after that an
epitaph upon peace defunct. But then, on the other
hand, there are others that advance our cause no less
than do the Furies themselves. They are a sort of animals
in black and white vestments, ash-coloured coats,
and various other dresses, that are always hovering about
the courts of the princes, and are continually instilling
into their ears the love of war, and exhorting the nobility
and common people to it, haranguing them in their sermons
that it is a just, holy, and religious war. And
that which would make you stand in admiration at the
confidence of these men is the cry of both parties. In
France they preach it up that God is on the French side,
and that they can never be overcome that has God for
their protector. In England and Spain the cry is, "The
war is not the king's, but God's"; therefore, if they do
but fight like men, they depend on getting the victory,
and if anyone should chance to fall in the battle, he will
not die, but fly directly up into heaven, arms and all.</p>

<h3 id="ch_132"><a name="In_Praise_of_Folly" id="In_Praise_of_Folly">In Praise of Folly</a></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Praise of Folly" was written in Latin, and the title, "Encomium
MoriÃ¦," is a pun on the name of his friend, the Greek
word <i xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">moria</i> (folly) curiously corresponding with his host's family
name. The purpose of this inimitable satire is to cover every
species of foolish men and women with ridicule. Yet through
all the biting sarcasm runs an unbroken vein of religious seriousness,
the contrast greatly enhancing the impression produced
by this masterpiece.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;Stultitia's Declamation</i></h4>

<p>In whatever manner I, the Goddess of Folly, may be
generally spoken of by mortals, yet I assert it emphatically
that it is from me, Stultitia, and from my influence
only, that gods and men derive all mirth and cheerfulness.
You laugh, I see. Well, even that is a telling
argument in my favour. Actually now, in this most
numerous assembly, as soon as ever I have opened my
mouth, the countenances of all have instantly brightened
up with fresh and unwonted hilarity, whereas but a few
moments ago you were all looking demure and woebegone.</p>

<p>On my very brow my name is written. No one would
take me, Stultitia, for Minerva. No one would contend
that I am the Goddess of Wisdom. The mere expression
of my countenance tells its own tale. Not only am
I incapable of deceit, but even those who are under my
sway are incapable of deceit likewise. From my illustrious
sire, Plutus [Wealth], I glory to be sprung, for
he, and no other, was the great progenitor of gods and
men, and I care not what Hesiod, or Homer, or even
Jupiter himself may maintain to the contrary. Everything,
I affirm, is subjected to the control of Plutus.
War, peace, empires, designs, judicial decisions, weddings,
treaties, alliances, laws, arts, things ludicrous and
things serious, are all administered in obedience to his
sovereign will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Now notice the admirable foresight which nature exercises,
in order to ensure that men shall never be destitute
of folly as the principal ingredient in their constitution.
Wisdom, as your divines and moralists put it,
consists in men being guided by their reason; and folly,
in their being actuated by their passions. See then here
what Jupiter has done. In order to prevent the life of
man from being utterly intolerable, he has endowed him
with reason in singularly small proportion to his passions&mdash;only,
so to speak, as a half-ounce is to a pound.
And whereas he has dispersed his passions over every
portion of his body, he has confined his reason to a narrow
little crevice in his skull.</p>

<p>And yet, of these silly human beings, the male sex is
born under the necessity of transacting the business of
the world. When Jupiter was taking counsel with me I
advised him to add a woman to the man&mdash;a creature
foolish and frivolous, but full of laughter and sweetness,
who would season and sweeten by her folly the sadness
of his manly intelligence.</p>

<p>When Plato doubted whether or not he should place
women in the class of rational animals, he really only
wished to indicate the remarkable silliness of that sex.
Yet women will not be so absolutely senseless as to be
offended if I, a woman myself, the goddess Stultitia, tell
them thus plainly that they are fools. They will, if they
look at the matter aright, be flattered by it. For they
are by many degrees more favoured creatures than men.
They have beauty&mdash;and oh, what a gift is that! By its
power they rule the rulers of the world.</p>

<p>The supreme wish of women is to win the admiration
of men, and they have no more effectual means to this
end than folly. Men, no doubt, will contend that it is
the pleasure they have in women's society, and not their
folly, that attracts them. I answer that their pleasure
is folly, and nothing but folly, in which they delight.
You see, then, from what fountain is derived the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
and most exquisite enjoyment that falls to man's lot
in life. But there are some men (waning old crones,
most of them) who love their glasses better than the
lasses, and place their chief delight in tippling. Others
love to make fools of themselves to raise a laugh at a
feast, and I beg to say that of laughter, fun, and pleasantry,
I&mdash;Folly&mdash;am the sole purveyor.</p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;The Mockery of Wisdom</i></h4>

<p>So much for the notion that wisdom is of any use in
the pleasures of life. Well, the next thing that our gods
of wisdom will assert is that wisdom is necessary for
affairs of state. Says Plato, "Those states will prosper
whose rulers are guided by the spirit of philosophy."
With this opinion I totally disagree. Consult history,
and it will tell you that the two Catos, Brutus, Cassius,
the Gracchi, Cicero, and Marcus Antoninus all disturbed
the tranquillity of the state and brought down on them
by their philosophy the disgust and disfavour of the citizens.
And who are the men who are most prone, from
weariness of life, to seek to put an end to it? Why, men
of reputed wisdom. Not to mention Diogenes, the
Catos, the Cassii, and the Bruti, there is the remarkable
case of Chiron, who, though he actually had immortality
conferred on him, voluntarily preferred death.</p>

<p>You see, then, that if men were universally wise, the
world would be depopulated, and there would be need
of a new creation. But, since the world generally is under
the influence of folly and not of wisdom, the case is,
happily, different. I, Folly, by inspiring men with hopes
of good things they will never get, so charm away their
woes that they are far from wishing to die. Nay, the
less cause there is for them to desire to live, the more,
nevertheless, do they love life. It is of my bounty that
you see everywhere men of Nestorean longevity, mumbling,
without brains, without teeth, whose hair is white,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
whose heads are bald, so enamoured of life, so eager to
look youthful, that they use dyes, wigs, and other disguises,
and take to wife some frisky heifer of a creature;
while aged and cadaverous-looking women are seen
caterwauling, and, as the Greeks express it, behaving
goatishly, in order to induce some beauteous Phaon to
pay court to them.</p>

<p>As to the wisdom of the learned professions, the more
empty-headed and the more reckless any member of any
one of them is, the more he will be thought of. The
physician is always in request, and yet medicine, as it is
now frequently practised, is nothing but a system of
pure humbug. Next in repute to the physicians stand
the pettifogging lawyers, who are, according to the philosophers,
a set of asses. And asses, I grant you that, they
are. Nevertheless, it is by the will and pleasure of these
asses that the business of the world is transacted, and
they make fortunes while the poor theologians starve.</p>

<p>By the immortal gods, I solemnly swear to you that
the happiest men are those whom the world calls fools,
simpletons, and blockheads. For they are entirely devoid
of the fear of death. They have no accusing consciences
to make them fear it. They are, happily, without
the experience of the thousands of cares that lacerate
the minds of other men. They feel no shame, no solicitude,
no ambition, no envy, no love. And, according to
the theologians, they are free from any imputation of
the guilt of sin! Ah, ye besotted men of wisdom, you
need no further evidence than the ills you have gone
through to convince you from what a mass of calamities
I have delivered my idiotic favourites.</p>

<p>To be deceived, people say, is wretched. But I hold
that what is most wretched is not to be deceived. They
are in great error who imagine that a man's happiness
consists in things as they are. No; it consists entirely
in his opinion of what they are. Man is so constituted
that falsehood is far more agreeable to him than truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Does anyone need proof of this? Let him visit the
churches, and assuredly he will find it. If solemn truth
is dwelt on, the listeners at once become weary, yawn,
and sleep; but if the orator begins some silly tale, they
are all attention. And the saints they prefer to appeal
to are those whose histories are most made up of fable
and romance. Though to be deceived adds much more
to your happiness than not to be deceived, it yet costs
you much less trouble.</p>

<p>And now to pass to another argument in my favour.
Among all the praises of Bacchus this is the chief, that
he drives away care; but he does it only for a short time,
and then all your care comes again. How much more
complete are the benefits mankind derive from me! I
also afford them intoxication, but an intoxication whose
influence is perennial, and all, too, without cost to them.
And my favours I deny to nobody. Mars, Apollo, Saturn,
PhÅ“bus, and Neptune are more chary of their bounties
and dole them out to their favourites only but I
confine my favours to none.</p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;Classification of Fools</i></h4>

<p>Of all the men whose doings I have witnessed, the
most sordid are men of trade, and appropriately so, for
they handle money, a very sordid thing indeed. Yet,
though they lie, pilfer, cheat, and impose on everybody,
as soon as they grow rich they are looked up to as
princes. But as I look round among the various classes
of men, I specially note those who are esteemed to possess
more than ordinary sagacity. Among these a foremost
place is occupied by the schoolmasters. How
miserable would these be were it not that I, Folly, of
my benevolence, ameliorate their wretchedness and render
them insanely happy in the midst of their drudgery!
Their lot is one of semi-starvation and of debasing slavery.
In the schools, those bridewells of uproar and confusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
they grow prematurely old and broken down,
Yet, thanks to my good services, they know not their
own misery. For in their own estimation they are
mighty fine fellows, strutting about and striking terror
into the hearts of trembling urchins, half scarifying the
little wretches with straps, canes, and birches. They
are, apparently, quite unconscious of the dust and dirt
with which their schoolrooms are polluted. In fact, their
own most wretched servitude is to them a kingdom of
felicity.</p>

<p>The poets owe less to me. Yet they, too, are enthusiastic
devotees of mine, for their entire business consists
in tickling the ears of fools with silly ditties and ridiculously
romantic tales. Of the services of my attendants,
Philautia [Self-approbation] and Kolakia [Flattery],
they never fail to avail themselves, and really I
do not know that there is any other class of men in the
world amongst whom I should find more devoted and
constant followers.</p>

<p>Moreover, there are the rhetoricians. Quintilian, the
prince of them all, has written an immense chapter on
no more serious subject than how to excite a laugh.
Those, again, who hunt after immortal fame in the domain
of literature unquestionably belong to my fraternity.
Poor fellows! They pass a wretched existence
poring over their manuscripts, and for what reward?
For the praise of the very, very limited few who are
capable of appreciating their erudition.</p>

<p>Very naturally, the barristers merit our attention next.
Talk of female garrulity! Why, I would back any one
of them to win a prize for chattering against any twenty
of the most talkative women that you could pick out.
And well indeed would it be if they had no worse fault
than that. I am bound to say that they are not only
loquacious, but pugnacious. Their quarrelsomeness is
astounding.</p>

<p>After these come the bearded and gowned philosophers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Their insane self-deception as to their sagacity
and learning is very delightful. They beguile their time
with computing the magnitude of the sun, moon, and
stars, and they assign causes for all the phenomena of
the universe, as if nature had initiated them into all her
secrets. In reality they know nothing, but profess to
know everything.</p>

<h4><i>IV.&mdash;On Princes and Pontiffs</i></h4>

<p>It is high time that I should say a few words to you
about kings and the royal princes belonging to their
courts. Very different are they from those whom I have
just been describing, who pretend to be wise when they
are the reverse, for these high personages frankly and
openly live a life of folly, and it is just that I should give
them their due, and frankly and openly tell them so.
They seem to regard it to be the duty of a king to
addict himself to the chase; to keep up a grand stud of
horses; to extract as much money as possible from the
people; to caress by every means in his power the vulgar
populace, in order to win their good graces, and so
make them the subservient tools of his tyrannical behests.</p>

<p>As for the grandees of the court, a more servile, insipid,
empty-headed set than the generality of them you
will fail to find anywhere. Yet they wish to be regarded
as the greatest personalities on earth. Not a very modest
wish, and yet, in one respect, they are modest
enough. For instance, they wish to be bedecked with
gold and gems and purple, and other external symbols
of worth and wisdom, but nothing further do they require.</p>

<p>These courtiers, however, are superlatively happy in
the belief that they are perfectly virtuous. They lie in
bed till noon. Then they summon their chaplain to their
bedside to offer up the sacrifice of the mass, and as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
hireling priest goes through his solemn farce with perfunctory
rapidity, they, meanwhile, have all but dropped
off again into a comfortable condition of slumber. After
this they betake themselves to breakfast; and that is
scarcely over when dinner supervenes. And then come
their pastimes&mdash;their dice, their cards, and their gambling&mdash;their
merriment with jesters and buffoons, and
their gallantries with court favourites.</p>

<p>Next let us turn our attention to popes, cardinals, and
bishops, who have long rivalled, if they do not surpass,
the state and magnificence of princes. If bishops did
but bear in mind that a pastoral staff is an emblem of
pastoral duties, and that the cross solemnly carried before
them is a reminder of the earnestness with which
they should strive to crucify the flesh, their lot would
be one replete with sadness and solicitude. As things
are, a right bonny time do they spend, providing abundant
pasturage for themselves, and leaving their flocks
to the negligent charge of so-called friars and vicars.</p>

<p>Fortune favours the fool. We colloquially speak of
him and such as him as "lucky birds," while, when we
speak of a wise man, we proverbially describe him as
one who has been "born under an evil star," and as one
whose "horse will never carry him to the front." If you
wish to get a wife, mind, above all things, that you beware
of wisdom; for the girls, without exception, are
heart and soul so devoted to fools, that you may rely
on it a man who has any wisdom in him they will shun
as they would a vampire.</p>

<p>And now, to sum up much in a few words, go among
what classes of men you will, go among popes, princes,
cardinals, judges, magistrates, friends, foes, great men,
little men, and you will not fail to find that a man with
plenty of money at his command has it in his power to
obtain everything that he sets his heart upon. A wise
man, however, despises money. And what is the consequence?
Everyone despises him!</p>

<h2 id="ch_140"><a name="GESTA_ROMANORUM" id="GESTA_ROMANORUM">GESTA ROMANORUM</a></h2>

<h3>A Story-Book of the Middle Ages</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The "Gesta Romanorum," or "Deeds of the Romans," a
quaint collection of moral tales compiled by the monks, was
used in the Middle Ages for pulpit instruction. Hence the curious
"Applications" to the stories, two of which are here given
as examples. Wynkyn de Worde was the first to print the
"Gesta" in English, about 1510. His version is based on Latin
manuscripts of English origin, and differs from the first edition,
and from the Latin text printed abroad about 1473. The
stories have little to do with authentic Roman history, and
abound in amusing confusions, contradictions, and anachronisms.
But their interest is undeniable, and they form the source
of many famous pieces of English literature. In the English
"Gesta" occur the originals of the bond and casket incidents in
"The Merchant of Venice."</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;Of Love</i></h4>

<p>Pompey was a wise and powerful king. He had one
well-beloved daughter, who was very beautiful. Her
he committed to the care of five soldiers, who were to
guard her night and day. Before the door of the princess's
chamber they hung a burning lamp, and, moreover,
they kept a loud-barking dog to rouse them from sleep.
But the lady panted for the pleasures of the world, and
one day, looking abroad, she was espied by a certain
amorous duke, who made her many fair promises.</p>

<p>Hoping much from these, the princess slew the dog,
put out the light, and fled by night with the duke. Now,
there was in the palace a certain doughty champion, who
pursued the fugitives and beheaded the duke. He
brought the lady home again; but her father would not
see her, and thenceforward she passed her time bewailing
her misdeeds.</p>

<p>Now, at court there was a wise and skilful mediator,
who, being moved with compassion, reconciled the lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
with her father and betrothed her to a powerful nobleman.
The king then gave his daughter diverse gifts.
These were a rich, flowing tunic inscribed with the
words, "Forgiven. Sin no more"; and a golden coronet
with the legend, "Thy dignity is from me." Her
champion gave her a ring, engraved, "I have loved
thee; learn thou to love." Likewise the mediator bestowed
a ring, saying, "What have I done? How much?
Why?" A third ring was given by the king's son, with
the words: "Despise not thy nobility." A fourth ring,
from her brother, bore the motto: "Approach! Fear
not. I am thy brother." Her husband gave a golden
coronet, confirming his wife in the inheritance of his
possessions, and superscribed: "Now thou are espoused,
sin no more."</p>

<p>The lady kept these gifts as long as she lived. She
regained the affections of those whom her folly had
estranged, and closed her days in peace.</p>

<h5>APPLICATION</h5>

<p>My beloved, the king is our Heavenly Father; the
daughter is the soul; the guardian soldiers are the five
senses; the lamp is the will; the dog is conscience; the
duke is the Evil One. The mediator is Christ. The
cloak is our Lord's wounded body. The champion and
the brother are likewise Christ; the coronet is His crown
of thorns; the rings are the wounds in His hands and
feet. He is also the Spouse. Let us study to keep these
gifts uninjured.</p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;Of Fidelity</i></h4>

<p>The subject of a certain king, being captured by
pirates, wrote to his father for ransom; but the father
refused, and the youth was left wasting in prison. Now,
his captor had a beautiful and virtuous daughter, who
came to comfort the prisoner. At first he was too disconsolate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
to listen to her, but at length he begged her
to try to set him free. The lady feared her father's
wrath, but at last, on promise of marriage, she freed the
young man, and fled with him to his own country. His
father said, "Son, I am overjoyed at thy return, but
who is the lady under thy escort?"</p>

<p>When his son told him, he charged him, on pain of
losing his inheritance, not to marry her.</p>

<p>"But she released me from deadly peril," said the
youth.</p>

<p>The father answered, "Son, thou mayest not confide
in her, for she hath deceived her own father; and, furthermore,
although she indeed set thee free, it was but
to oblige thee to marry her. And since it was an unworthy
passion that was the source of thy liberty, I
think that she ought not to be thy wife."</p>

<p>When the lady heard these reasons, she answered
thus, "I have not deceived my parent. He that deceives
diminishes a certain good. But my father is so rich that
he needs not any addition. Wherefore, your son's ransom
would have left him but little richer, while you it
would have utterly impoverished. I have thus served
you, and done my father no injury. As for unworthy
passion, that arises from wealth, honours, or a handsome
appearance, none of which your son possessed, for
he had not even enough to procure his ransom, and imprisonment
had destroyed his beauty. Therefore, I
freed him out of compassion."</p>

<p>When the father heard this, he could object nothing
more. So the son married the lady with great pomp,
and closed his life in peace.</p>

<h5>APPLICATION</h5>

<p>My beloved, the son is the human race, led captive by
the devil. The father is the world, that will not redeem
the sinner, but loves to detain him. The daughter is
Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;O Venial Sin</i></h4>

<p>Julian, a noble soldier, fond of the chase, was one day
pursuing a stag, which turned and addressed him thus,
"Thou who pursuest me so fiercely shalt one day destroy
thy parents."</p>

<p>In great alarm, Julian sought a far country, where he
enlisted with a certain chieftain. For his renowned
services in war and peace he was made a knight, and
wedded to the widow of a castellan, with her castle as a
dowry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his parents sought him sorrowing, and
coming at length to Julian's castle in his absence, they
told his wife their story. The lady, for the love she
bore her husband, put them into her own bed, and early
in the morning went forth to her devotions. Julian returned,
and softly entering his wife's apartment, saw two
persons therein, and was filled with terrible alarm for
his lady's fealty.</p>

<p>Without pause, he slew both, and hurried out. Meeting
his wife in the church porch, he fell into amazement,
and asked who they might be. Hearing the truth, he
was shaken with an agony of tears, and cried, "Accursed
that I am! Dearest wife, forgive, and receive my last
farewell!"</p>

<p>"Nay," she replied. "Wilt thou abandon me, beloved,
and leave me widowed? I, that have shared thy
happiness will now share thy grief!"</p>

<p>Together they departed to a great and dangerous
river, where many had perished. There they built a
hospital, where they abode in contrition, ferrying over
such as wished to cross the river, and cherishing the
poor. After many years, Julian was aroused at midnight
by a dolorous voice calling his name. He found
and ferried over a leper, perishing with cold. Failing
to warm the wretch by other means, Julian placed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
in his own bed, and strove by the heat of his own body
to restore him. After a while he who seemed sick and
cold and leprous appeared robed in immortal splendour,
and, waving his light wings, seemed ready to mount up
into heaven. Turning upon his wondering host a look
of the utmost benignity, the visitant exclaimed, "Julian,
the Lord hath sent me to thee to announce the acceptance
of thy contrition. Ere long thou and thy partner will
sleep in Him."</p>

<p>So saying, the angelic messenger disappeared, and
Julian and his wife, after a short time occupied in good
works, died in peace.</p>

<h4><i>IV.&mdash;Of the End of Sinners</i></h4>

<p>Dionysius records that Perillus, wishing to become the
artificer of Phalaris, the cruel tyrant of Agrigentum,
presented him with a brazen bull. In its side was a
secret door, for the entry of those who should be burned
to death within. The idea was that the agonised cries
of the victim, resembling the roaring of a bull and nothing
human, should arouse no feeling of mercy. The
king, highly applauding the invention, said, "Friend, the
value of thy industry is still untried; more cruel even
than the people account me, thou thyself shalt be the
first victim."</p>

<p>There is no law more equitable than that "the artificer
of death should perish by his own devices," as Ovid hath
observed.</p>

<h4><i>V.&mdash;Of Too Much Pride</i></h4>

<p>As the Emperor Jovinian lay abed, reflecting on his
power and possessions, he impiously asked, "Is there
any other god than I?"</p>

<p>Amid such thoughts he fell asleep.</p>

<p>Now, on the morrow, as he followed the chase, he separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
himself from his followers in order to bathe in
a stream. And as he bathed, one like him in all respects
took the emperor's dress, and arraying himself
in them, mounted the monarch's horse, and joined the
royal retinue, who knew him not from their master.
Jovinian, horseless and naked, was vexed beyond
measure.</p>

<p>"Miserable that I am," he exclaimed, "I will to a
knight who lives hard by. Him have I promoted; haply
he will befriend me." But when he declared himself
to be Jovinian, the knight ordered him to be flogged.
"Oh, my God!" exclaimed the emperor, "is it possible
that one whom I have loaded with honours should use
me thus?"</p>

<p>Next he sought out a certain duke, one of his privy
counsellors, and told his tale.</p>

<p>"Poor, mad wretch," said the duke. "I am but
newly returned from the palace, where I left the
emperor."</p>

<p>He therefore had Jovinian flogged, and imprisoned.
Contriving to escape, he went to the palace. "Surely,"
he reflected, "my servants will know me." But his own
porter denied him. Nevertheless, he persuaded the man
to take a secret sign to the empress, and to demand his
imperial robes. The empress, sitting at table with the
feigned emperor, was much disturbed, and said, "Oh,
my lord, there is a vile fellow at the gate who declares
the most hidden passages of our life, and says he is my
husband."</p>

<p>Being condemned to be dragged by a horse's tail,
Jovinian, in despair, sought his confessor's cell. But
the holy man would not open to him, although at last,
being adjured by the name of the Crucified, he gave him
shrift at the window. Thereupon he knew the emperor,
and giving him some clothes, bade him show himself
again at the palace. This he did, and was received with
due obeisance. Still, none knew which was the emperor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
and which the impostor, until the feigned emperor
spake.</p>

<p>"I," said he, "am the guardian angel of the king's
soul. He has now purged his pride by penance; let
your obedience wait on him."</p>

<p>So saying, he disappeared. The emperor gave thanks
to God, lived happily after, and finished his days in
peace.</p>

<h4><i>VI.&mdash;Of Avarice</i></h4>

<p>A covetous and wicked carpenter placed all his riches
in a log, which he hid by his fireside. Now, the sea
swept away that part of his house, and drifted the log
to a city where lived a generous man. He found the
log, cleft it, and laid the gold in a secure place until he
should discover the owner.</p>

<p>Now, the carpenter, seeking his wealth with lamentations,
came by chance to the house of him that had found
it. Mentioning his loss, his host said to himself, "I will
prove if God will that I return his money to him." He
then made three cakes, one filled with earth, the second
with dead men's bones, and the third with some of the
lost gold. The carpenter, being invited to choose,
weighed the cakes in his hand, and finding that with
earth heaviest, took it.</p>

<p>"And if I want more, my worthy host," said he, "I
will choose that," laying his hand on the cake containing
the bones. "The third you may keep for yourself."</p>

<p>"Thou miserable varlet," cried the host. "It is thine
own gold, which plainly the Lord wills not that I return
to thee."</p>

<p>So saying, he distributed all the treasure among the
poor, and drove the carpenter away from his house in
great tribulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<h4><i>VII.&mdash;Of Temporary Tribulation</i></h4>

<p>Antiochus, king of Antioch, had one lovely daughter,
who was much courted. But her father, seeking to
withhold her from marriage, proposed a riddle to every
suitor, and each one who failed to guess the answer was
put to death. Among the suitors came Apollonius, the
young Prince of Tyre, who guessed the riddle, the
answer to which revealed a shameful secret of the king's
life. Antiochus, loudly denying that the young man had
hit upon the truth, sent him away for thirty days, and
bade him try again, on pain of death. So Apollonius
departed.</p>

<p>Now, Antiochus sent his steward, Taliarchus, to Tyre,
with orders to destroy Apollonius; but by the time the
steward arrived the prince had put to sea in a fleet laden
with treasure, corn, and many changes of raiment.
Hearing this, Antiochus set a price on the head of Apollonius,
and pursued him with a great armament. The
prince, arriving at Tharsus, saved that city from famine
by the supplies he brought, and a statue was raised in
his honour. Then, by the advice of one Stranguilio and
his wife, Dionysias, he sailed to Pentapolis. On the way
he suffered shipwreck, and reached that city on a plank.
There, by his skill in athletics and music, he won the
favour of Altistrates, the king, who gave him his daughter
to wife.</p>

<p>Some time after, hearing that the wicked Antiochus
and his daughter had been killed by lightning, Apollonius
and his wife set sail to take up the sovereignty of
Antioch, which had fallen to him. On the way the lady
died, leaving a new-born daughter. The prince placed
his wife's body in a coffin smeared with pitch, and committed
it to the deep. In the coffin he put money and a
tablet, instructing anyone who found the body to bury
it sumptuously. Apollonius returned to Pentapolis and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
gave his infant daughter into the care of Stranguilio and
Dionysias. Then he himself sailed away and wandered
the world in deep grief. In the meantime, his wife's
body was cast up at Ephesus, and was found by the
physician Cerimon, one of whose pupils revived the lady,
who became a vestal of Diana.</p>

<p>Years passed, and the child, who was called Tharsia,
incurred the jealousy of Dionysias, because she was
fairer than her own child Philomatia. Dionysias
sought to kill Tharsia, who, at the critical moment, was
carried away by pirates, and sold into slavery at Machylena.
There her beauty and goodness protected her, so
that none who came to her master's evil house would do
her wrong. She persuaded her owner to let her earn
her bread by her accomplishments in music and the unravelling
of hard sayings. Thus she won the love of the
prince of that place, Athanagoras, who protected her.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards a strange fleet came to Machylena.
Athanagoras, struck by the beauty of one of the
ships, went on board, and asked to see the owner. He
found a rugged and melancholy man, who was none
other than Apollonius. In due time that prince was
joyfully reunited with his child, who was given in marriage
to her perserver. Speedy vengeance overtook
Tharsia's cruel owner, and later Stranguilio and Dionysias
suffered for their misdeeds. Being warned by a
dream to return to Ephesus, Apollonius found his wife
in the precinct of the vestals, and, together with her, he
reigned long and happily over Antioch and Tyre. After
death he went into everlasting life. To which may God,
of His infinite mercy, lead us all.</p>

<h3>The Citizen of the World</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Citizen of the World," after appearing in the "Public
Ledger" newspaper in 1760&ndash;61, was published in two volumes
in 1762, with the sub-title, "Letters from a Chinese Philosopher,
Residing in London, to his Friends in the East." It
established Goldsmith's literary reputation (see Vol. IV, p. 275).
The author's main purpose was to indulge in a keen, but not ill-natured,
satire upon Western, and especially upon English, civilisation;
but sometimes the satiric manner yields place to the
philosophical.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>The Troubles of the Great</i><br />

<span class="subhead">FROM LIEN CHI ALTANGI TO FUM HOAM, FIRST PRESIDENT
OF THE CEREMONIAL ACADEMY AT PEKIN</span></h4>

<p>The princes of Europe have found out a manner of
rewarding their subjects who have behaved well, by presenting
them with about two yards of blue ribbon, which
is worn over the shoulder. They who are honoured with
this mark of distinction are called knights, and the king
himself is always the head of the order. This is a very
frugal method of recompensing the most important services,
and it is very fortunate for kings that their subjects
are satisfied with such trifling rewards. Should a
nobleman happen to lose his leg in battle, the king presents
him with two yards of ribbon, and he is paid for
the loss of his limb. Should an ambassador spend all
his paternal fortunes in supporting the honour of his
country abroad, the king presents him with two yards of
ribbon, which is to be considered as an equivalent to his
estate. In short, while a European king has a yard of
blue or green ribbon left, he need be under no apprehension
of wanting statesmen, generals, and soldiers.</p>

<p>I cannot sufficiently admire those kingdoms in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
men with large patrimonial estates are willing thus to
undergo real hardships for empty favours. A person,
already possessed of a competent fortune, who undertakes
to enter the career of ambition feels many real
inconveniences from his station, while it procures him
no real happiness that he was not possessed of before.
He could eat, drink, and sleep before he became a
courtier, as well, perhaps better, than when invested with
his authority.</p>

<p>What real good, then, does an addition to a fortune
already sufficient procure? Not any. Could the great
man, by having his fortune increased, increase also his
appetite, then precedence might be attended with real
amusement. But, on the contrary, he finds his desire for
pleasure often lessen as he takes pains to be able to improve
it; and his capacity of enjoyment diminishes as his
fortune happens to increase.</p>

<p>Instead, therefore, of regarding the great with envy,
I generally consider them with some share of compassion.
I look upon them as a set of good-natured, misguided
people, who are indebted to us, and not to themselves,
for all the happiness they enjoy. For our pleasure,
and not their own, they sweat under a cumbrous
heap of finery; for our pleasure, the hackneyed train, the
slow-parading pageant, with all the gravity of grandeur,
moves in review; a single coat, or a single footman,
answers all the purposes of the most indolent refinement
as well; and those who have twenty may be said to keep
one for their own pleasure, and the other nineteen for
ours. So true is the observation of Confucius, "That
we take greater pains to persuade others that we are
happy than in endeavouring to think so ourselves."</p>

<p>But though this desire of being seen, of being made
the subject of discourse, and of supporting the dignities
of an exalted station, be troublesome to the ambitious,
yet it is well that there are men thus willing to exchange
ease and safety for danger and a ribbon. We lose nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
by their vanity, and it would be unkind to endeavour
to deprive a child of its rattle.... Adieu.</p>

<h4><i>The Folly of the Recluse</i><br />

<span class="subhead">FROM LIEN CHI ALTANGI TO HINGPO, HIS SON</span></h4>

<p>Books, my son, while they teach us to respect the interests
of others, often make us unmindful of our own;
while they instruct the youthful reader to grasp at social
happiness, he grows miserable in detail. I dislike, therefore,
the philosopher, who describes the inconveniences
of life in such pleasing colours that the pupil grows
enamoured of distress, longs to try the charms of poverty,
meets it without dread, nor fears its inconveniences
till he severely feels them.</p>

<p>A youth who has thus spent his life among books, new
to the world, and unacquainted with man but by philosophic
information, may be considered as a being whose
mind is filled with the vulgar errors of the wise. He
first has learned from books, and then lays it down as a
maxim that all mankind are virtuous or vicious in excess;
warm, therefore, in attachments, and steadfast in enmity,
he treats every creature as a friend or foe. Upon a
closer inspection of human nature he perceives that he
should have moderated his friendship, and softened his
severity; he finds no character so sanctified that has not
its failings, none so infamous but has somewhat to
attract our esteem; he beholds impiety in lawn, and fidelity
in fetters.</p>

<p>He now, therefore, but too late, perceives that his
regards should have been more cool, and his hatred less
violent; that the truly wise seldom court romantic friendships
with the good, and avoid, if possible, the resentment
even of the wicked; every movement gives him
fresh instances that the bonds of friendship are broken
if drawn too closely, and that those whom he has treated
with disrespect more than retaliate the injury; at length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
therefore, he is obliged to confess that he has declared
war upon the vicious half of mankind, without being
able to form an alliance among the virtuous to espouse
his quarrel.</p>

<p>Our book-taught philosopher, however, is now too far
advanced to recede; and though poverty be the just consequence
of the many enemies his conduct has created,
yet he is resolved to meet it without shrinking. "Come,
then, O Poverty! for what is there in thee dreadful to
the Wise? Temperance, Health, and Frugality walk in
thy train; Cheerfulness and Liberty are ever thy companions.
Come, then, O Poverty, while kings stand by, and
gaze with admiration at the true philosopher's resignation!"</p>

<p>The goddess appears, for Poverty ever comes at the
call; but, alas! he finds her by no means the charming
figure books and his warm imagination had painted. All
the fabric of enthusiasm is at once demolished, and a
thousand miseries rise upon its ruins, while Contempt,
with pointing finger, is foremost in the hideous procession.</p>

<p>The poor man now finds that he can get no kings to
look at him while he is eating; he finds that, in proportion
as he grows poor, the world turns its back upon him,
and gives him leave to act the philosopher in all the
majesty of solitude. Spleen now begins to take up the
man; not distinguishing in his resentments, he regards all
mankind with detestation, and commencing man-hater,
seeks solitude to be at liberty to rail.</p>

<p>It has been said that he who retires to solitude is
either a beast or an angel. The censure is too severe,
and the praise unmerited; the discontented being who
retires from society is generally some good-natured man,
who has begun life without experience, and knew not
how to gain it in his intercourse with mankind. Adieu.</p>

<h4><i>On Mad Dogs</i><br />

<span class="subhead">FROM LIEN CHI ALTANGI TO FUM HOAM</span></h4>

<p>Indulgent Nature seems to have exempted this island
from many of those epidemic evils which are so fatal in
other parts of the world. But though the nation be
exempt from real evils, think not, my friend, that it is
more happy on this account than others. They are
afflicted, it is true, with neither famine nor pestilence,
but then there is a disorder peculiar to the country, which
every season makes strange ravages among them; it
spreads with pestilential rapidity, and infects almost
every rank of people; what is still more strange, the
natives have no name for this peculiar malady, though
well enough known to foreign physicians by the name of
epidemic terror.</p>

<p>A season is never known to pass in which the people
are not visited by this cruel calamity in one shape or
another, seemingly different, though ever the same. The
people, when once infected, lose their relish for happiness,
saunter about with looks of despondence, ask after
the calamities of the day, and receive no comfort but in
heightening each other's distress. A dread of mad dogs
is the epidemic terror which now prevails, and the whole
nation is at present actually groaning under the malignity
of its influence.</p>

<p>It is pleasant enough for a neutral being like me, who
have no share in these ideal calamities, to mark the
stages of this national disease. The terror at first feebly
enters with a little dog that had gone through a neighbouring
village, that was thought to be mad by several
who had seen him. The next account comes that a mastiff
ran through a certain town, and had bit five geese,
which immediately ran mad, foamed at the bill, and died
in great agonies soon after. Then comes an affecting
history of a little boy bit in the leg, and gone down to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
dipped in the salt water; when the people have sufficiently
shuddered at that, they are next congealed with a
frightful account of a man who was said lately to have
died from a bite he had received some years before.</p>

<p>My landlady, a good-natured woman, but a little credulous,
waked me some mornings ago, before the usual
hour, with horror and astonishment in her looks; she
desired me, if I had any regard for my safety, to keep
within, for a few days ago so dismal an accident had
happened as to put all the world upon their guard. A
mad dog down in the country, she assured me, had bit a
farmer who, soon becoming mad, ran into his own yard,
and bit a fine brindled cow; the cow quickly became as
mad as the man, began to foam at the mouth, and raising
herself up, walked about on her hind legs, sometimes
barking like a dog, and sometimes attempting to talk like
the farmer.</p>

<p>Were most stories of this nature thoroughly examined,
it would be found that numbers of such as have been
said to suffer were in no way injured; and that of those
who have been actually bitten, not one in a hundred was
bit by a mad dog. Such accounts in general, therefore,
only serve to make the people miserable by false terrors.</p>

<p>Of all the beasts that graze the lawn or hunt the forest,
a dog is the only animal that, leaving his fellows,
attempts to cultivate the friendship of man; no injuries
can abate his fidelity; no distress induce him to forsake
his benefactor; studious to please and fearing to offend,
he is still an humble, steadfast dependent, and in him
alone fawning is not flattery. How unkind, then, to
torture this faithful creature who has left the forest to
claim the protection of man! How ungrateful a return
to the trusty animal for all his services! Adieu.</p>

<h4><i>On Elections</i><br />

<span class="subhead">FROM LIEN CHI ALTANGI TO FUM HOAM</span></h4>

<p>The English are at present employed in celebrating a
feast, which becomes general every seventh year: the
parliament of the nation being then dissolved, and another
appointed to be chosen. This solemnity falls infinitely
short of our Feast of the Lanterns in magnificence and
splendour; it is also surpassed by others of the East in
unanimity and pure devotion; but no festival in the world
can compare with it for eating.</p>

<p>To say the truth, eating seems to make a grand ingredient
in all English parties of zeal, business, or amusement.
When a church is to be built, or an hospital endowed,
the directors assemble, and instead of consulting upon it,
they eat upon it, by which means the business goes forward
with success. When the poor are to be relieved,
the officers appointed to dole out public charity assemble
and eat upon it. Nor has it ever been known that they
filled the bellies of the poor till they had satisfied their
own. But in the election of magistrates the people seem
to exceed all bounds.</p>

<p>What amazes me is that all this good living no way
contributes to improve their good humour. On the contrary,
they seem to lose their temper as they lose their
appetites; every morsel they swallow, and every glass
they pour down, serves to increase their animosity.
Upon one of these occasions I have actually seen a
bloody-minded man-milliner sally forth at the head of a
mob, to face a desperate pastrycook, who was general of
the opposite party.</p>

<p>I lately made an excursion to a neighbouring village,
in order to be a spectator of the ceremonies practised.
Mixing with the crowd, I was conducted to the hall
where the magistrates are chosen; but what tongue can
describe this scene of confusion! The whole crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
seemed equally inspired with anger, jealousy, politics,
patriotism, and punch. I remarked one figure that was
carried up by two men upon this occasion. I at first
began to pity his infirmities as natural, but soon found
the fellow so drunk that he could not stand; another
made his appearance to give his vote, but though he could
stand, he actually lost the use of his tongue, and remained
silent; a third, who, though excessively drunk, could both
stand and speak, being asked the candidate's name for
whom he voted, could be prevailed upon to make no
other answer but "Tobacco and brandy!" In short, an
election-hall seems to be a theatre, where every passion
is seen without disguise; a school where fools may readily
become worse, and where philosophers may gather wisdom.
Adieu.</p>

<h4><i>Opinions and Anecdotes</i></h4>

<p>The most ignorant nations have always been found to
think most highly of themselves.</p>

<p>It may sound fine in the mouth of a declaimer, when
he talks of subduing our appetites, of teaching every
sense to be content with a bare sufficiency, and of supplying
only the wants of nature; but is there not more satisfaction
in indulging these appetites, if with innocence and
safety, than in restraining them? Am I not better pleased
in enjoyment, than in the sullen satisfaction of thinking
that I can live without enjoyment?</p>

<p>When five brethren had set upon the great Emperor
Guisong, alone with his sabre he slew four of them;
he was struggling with the fifth, when his guards, coming
up, were going to cut the conspirator into a thousand
pieces. "No, no!" cried the emperor, with a placid
countenance. "Of all his brothers he is the only one
remaining; at least let one of the family be suffered to
live, that his aged parents may have somebody left to
feed and comfort them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
It was a fine saying of Nangfu the emperor, who,
being told that his enemies had raised an insurrection in
one of the distant provinces, said: "Come, then, my
friends, follow me, and I promise you that we shall
quickly destroy them." He marched forward, and the
rebels submitted upon his approach. All now thought
that he would take the most signal revenge, but were
surprised to see the captives treated with mildness and
humanity. "How!" cries his first minister, "is this the
manner in which you fulfil your promise? Your royal
word was given that your enemies should be destroyed,
and behold, you have pardoned all, and even caressed
some!" "I promised," replied the emperor, with a generous
air, "to destroy my <em>enemies</em>; I have fulfilled my
word, for see, they are enemies no longer; I have made
<em>friends</em> of them."</p>

<p>Well it were if rewards and mercy alone could regulate
the commonwealth; but since punishments are sometimes
necessary, let them at least be rendered terrible, by
being executed but seldom; and let justice lift her sword
rather to terrify than revenge.</p>

<h3>Introduction to the Literature of Europe</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The full volume of this work, "Introduction to the Literature
of Europe in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and Seventeenth Centuries,"
was published about 1837, and is a vast accumulation of
facts, but is lacking in organic unity, in vigour, and vitality.
Hallam's spelling of proper names has been followed throughout
this epitome. (Henry Hallam, biography; see Vol. XI, p. 255.)</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;Before the Fifteenth Century</i></h4>

<p>The establishment of the barbarian nations on the
ruins of the Roman Empire in the West was followed
by an almost universal loss of classical learning. The
last of the ancients, and one who forms a link with the
Middle Ages, is BoÃ«thius, whose "Consolation of
Philosophy" mingles a Christian sanctity with the lessons
of Greek and Roman sages. But after his death,
in 524, the downfall of learning and eloquence was inconceivably
rapid, and a state of general ignorance, except
here and there within the ecclesiastical hierarchy, lasted
for five centuries.</p>

<p>The British islands led the way in the slow restoration
of knowledge. The Irish monasteries, in the seventh
century, were the first to send out men of comparative
eminence, and the Venerable Bede, in the eighth century,
was probably superior to any other man whom the world
at that time possessed. Then came the days when
Charlemagne laid in his vast dominions the foundations
of learning.</p>

<p>In the tenth century, when England and Italy alike
were in the most deplorable darkness, France enjoyed an
age of illumination, and a generation or two later we
find many learned and virtuous churchmen in Germany.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
But it is not until the twelfth century that we enter on
a new epoch in European literary history, when universities
were founded, modern languages were cultivated,
the study of Roman law was systematically taken up,
and a return was made to a purer Latinity.</p>

<p>Next, we observe the rise of the scholastic theology
and philosophy, with their strenuous attempt at an alliance
between faith and reason. The dry and technical style
of these enquiries, their minute subdivisions of questions,
and their imposing parade of accuracy, served indeed to
stimulate subtlety of mind, but also hindered the revival
of polite literature and the free expansion of the intellect.</p>

<p>Dante and Petrarch are the morning stars of the modern
age. They lie outside our period, and we must pass
them over with a word. It is sufficient to notice that,
largely by their influence, we find, in the year 1400, a
national literature existing in no less than seven European
languages&mdash;three in the Spanish peninsula, the
French, the Italian, the German, and the English.</p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;The Fifteenth Century</i></h4>

<p>We now come to a very important event&mdash;the resuscitation
of the study of Greek in Italy. In 1423, Giovanni
Aurispa, of Sicily, brought over two hundred manuscripts
from Greece, including Plato, Plotinus, Diodorus, Pindar,
and many other classics. Manuel Chrysoloras, teacher of
Greek in Florence, had trained a school of Hellenists;
and copyists, translators, and commentators set to work
upon the masterpieces of the ancient world. We have
good reason to doubt whether, without the Italians of
those times, the revival of classical learning would ever
have occurred. The movement was powerfully aided
by Nicolas V., pope in 1447, who founded the Vatican
library, supported scholars, and encouraged authors.</p>

<p>Soon after 1450, the art of printing began to be applied
to the purposes of useful learning, and Bibles, classical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
texts, collections of fables; and other works were rapidly
given to the world. The accession to power of Lorenzo
de Medici in 1464 marks the revival of native Italian
genius in poetry, and under his influence the Platonic
academy, founded by his grandfather Cosmo, promoted a
variety of studies. But we still look in vain to England
for either learning or native genius. The reign of Edward
IV. is one of the lowest points in our literary annals.</p>

<p>In France, the "Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles," 1486, and
the poems of Villon, 1489, show a marked advance in
style. Many French "mysteries," or religious dramas,
belong to this period, and this early form of the dramatic
art had also much popularity in Germany and in Italy.
Literary activity, in France and in Germany, had become
regularly progressive by the end of the century.</p>

<p>Two men, Erasmus and BudÃ¦us, were now devoting
incessant labour, in Paris, to the study of Greek; and a
gleam of light broke out even in England, where William
Grocyn began, in 1491, to teach that language in Oxford.
On his visit to England, in 1497, Erasmus was delighted
with everything he found, and gave unbounded praise to
the scholarship of Grocyn, Colet, Linacre, and the young
Thomas More.</p>

<p>The fifteenth century was a period of awakening and
of strenuous effort. But if we ask what monuments of
its genius and erudition still receive homage, we can give
no very triumphant answer. Of the books then written,
how few are read now!</p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;The Sixteenth Century (1500&ndash;1550)</i></h4>

<p>In the early years of this century the press of Aldus
Manutius, who had settled in Venice in 1489, was publishing
many texts of the classics, Greek as well as Latin.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the regular drama was first
introduced into Europe. "Calandra," the earliest modern
comedy, was presented at Venice in 1508, and about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
same time the Spanish tragi-comedy of "Calisto and
MelibÅ“a" was printed. The pastoral romance, also,
made its appearance in Portugal; and the "Arcadia,"
1502, by the Italian Sannazaro, a work of this class, did
much to restore the correctness and elegance of Italian
prose. Peter Bembo's "Asolani," 1505, a dialogue on
love, has also been thought to mark an epoch in Italian
literature. At the same time, William Dunbar, with his
"Thistle and Rose," 1503, and his allegorical "Golden
Targe," was leading the van of British poetry.</p>

<p>The records of voyages of discovery begin to take a
prominent place. The old travels of Marco Polo, as well
as those of Sir John Mandeville, and the "Cosmography"
of Ptolemy, had been printed in the previous century;
but the stupendous discoveries of the close of that age
now fell to be told. The voyages of Cadamosto, a Venetian,
in Western Africa, appeared in 1507; and those of
Amerigo Vespucci, entitled "Mondo Nuovo," in the same
year. An epistle of Columbus himself had been printed
in Germany about 1493.</p>

<p>Leo X., who became pope in 1513, placed men of letters
in the most honourable stations of his court, and was
the munificent patron of poets, scholars, and printers.
Rucellai's "Rosmunda," a tragedy played before Leo in
1515, was the earliest known trial of blank verse. The
"Sophonisba" of Trissino, published in 1524, a play
written strictly on the Greek model, had been acted some
years before. Two comedies by Ariosto were presented
about 1512.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the printing press became very active in
Paris, Basle, and Germany, chiefly in preparing works
for the use of students in universities. But in respect of
learning, we have the testimony of Erasmus that neither
France, nor Germany, stood so high as England. In
Scotland, boys were being taught Latin in school; and
the translation of the Ã†neid by Gawin Douglas, completed
about 1513, shows, by its spirit and fidelity, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
degree of scholarship in the north. The only work of
real genius which England can claim in this age is the
"Utopia" of Sir Thomas More, first printed in 1516.</p>

<p>Erasmus diffuses a lustre over his age, which no other
name among the learned supplies. About 1517, he published
an enlarged edition of his "Adages," which displays
a surprising intimacy with Greek and Roman literature.
The most remarkable of them, in every sense, are
those which reflect with excessive bitterness on kings
and priests. Erasmus knew that the regular clergy were
not to be conciliated, and resolved to throw away the
scabbard; and his invectives against kings proceeded
from a just sense of the oppression of Europe in that
age by ambitious and selfish rulers.</p>

<p>We are now brought by necessary steps to the great
religious revolution known as the Reformation, with
which we are only concerned in so far as it modified
the history of literature. In all his dispute, Luther was
sustained by a prodigious force of popular opinion; and
the German nation was so fully awakened to the abuses
of the Church that, if neither Luther nor Zwingli had
ever been born, a great religious schism was still at hand.
Erasmus, who had so manifestly prepared the way for
the new reformers, continued, beyond the year 1520,
favourable to their cause. But some of Luther's tenets
he did not and could not approve; and he was already
disgusted by that intemperance of language which soon
led him to secede entirely from the Protestant side.</p>

<p>The laws of synchronism bring strange partners
together, and we may pass at once from Luther to
Ariosto, whose "Orlando Furioso" was printed at
Ferrara in 1516. Ariosto has been, after Homer, the
favourite poet of Europe. His grace and facility, his
clear and rapid stream of language, his variety of invention,
left him no rival.</p>

<p>No edition of "Amadis de Gaul" has been proved to
exist before that printed at Seville in 1519. This famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
romance was translated into French between 1540 and
1557, and into English by Munday in 1619.</p>

<p>A curious dramatic performance was represented in
Paris in 1511, and published in 1516. It is entitled
"Le Prince des Sots et la MÃ¨re sotte," by Peter Gringore;
its chief aim was to ridicule the Pope and the
court of Rome. Hans Sachs, a shoemaker of Nuremberg,
produced his first carnival play in 1517. The English
poets Hawes and Skelton fall within this period.</p>

<p>From 1520 to 1550, Italy, where the literature of
antiquity had been first cultivated, still retained her superiority
in the fine perception of its beauties, but the study
was proceeding also elsewhere in Europe. Few books of
that age give us more insight into its literary history and
the public taste than the "Circeronianus" of Erasmus,
against which Scaliger wrote with unmannerly invective.
The same period of thirty years is rich with poets, among
whom are the Spanish Mendoza, the Portuguese Ribero,
Marot in France, many hymn-writers in Germany; and
in England, Wyatt and Surrey. At this time also, Spain
was forming its national theatre, chiefly under the influence
of Lope de Rueda and of Torres Naharro, the
inventor of Spanish comedy. The most celebrated writer
of fiction in this age is Rabelais, than whom few have
greater fertility of language and imagination.</p>

<h4><i>IV.&mdash;The Sixteenth Century (1550&ndash;1600)</i></h4>

<p>Montaigne's "Essays," which first appeared at Bordeaux
in 1580, make an epoch in literature, being the
first appeal from the academy to the haunts of busy and
idle men; and this delightful writer had a vast influence
on English and French literature in the succeeding age.</p>

<p>Turning now to the Italian poets of our period, we
find that most of them are feeble copyists of Petrarch,
whose style Bembo had rendered so popular. Casa, Costanzo,
Baldi, Celio Magno, Bernardino Rota, Gaspara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Stampa, Bernado Tasso, father of the great Tasso, Peter
Aretin, and Firenzuola, flourished at this time. The
"Jerusalem" of Torquato Tasso is the great epic of
modern times; it is read with pleasure in almost every
canto, though the native melancholy of Tasso tinges all
his poem. It was no sooner published than it was
weighed against the "Orlando Furioso," and Europe has
not yet agreed which scale inclines.</p>

<p>Spanish poetry is adorned by Luis Ponce de Leon,
born in 1527, a religious and mystical lyric poet. The
odes of Herrera have a lyric elevation and richness of
phrase, derived from the study of Pindar and of the
Old Testament. Castillejo, playful and witty, attempted
to revive the popular poetry, and ridiculed the imitators
of Petrarch.</p>

<p>The great Camoens had now arisen in Portugal; his
"Lusiad," written in praise of the Lusitanian people, is
the mirror of his loving, courageous, generous, and patriotic
heart. Camoens is the chief Portuguese poet in this
age, and possibly in every other.</p>

<p>This was an age of verse in France. Pierre Ronsard,
Amadis Jamyn his pupil, Du Bartas, Pibrac, Desportes,
and many others, were gradually establishing the rules of
metre, and the Alexandrine was displacing the old verse
of ten syllables.</p>

<p>Of German poetry there is little to say; but England
had Lord Vaux's short pieces in "The Paradise of
Dainty Devices"; Sackville, with his "Induction" to the
"Mirrour of Magistrates," 1559; George Gascoyne,
whose "Steel Glass," 1576, is the earliest English satire;
and, above all, Spenser, whose "Shepherd's Kalendar"
appeared in 1579. This work was far more natural and
more pleasing than the other pastorals of the age.
Shakespeare's "Venus and Adonis," and his "Rape of
Lucrece," were published in 1593&ndash;94. Sir Philip Sidney,
Raleigh, Lodge, Breton, Marlowe, Green, Watson, Davison,
Daniel, and Michael Drayton were now writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
poems, and Drake has a list of more than two hundred
English poets of this time.</p>

<p>The great work of the period is, however, the "FaÃ«ry
Queen," the first three books of which were published in
1590, and the last three in 1596. Spenser excels Ariosto
in originality, force, and variety of character, and in
depth of reflection, but especially in the poetical cast of
feeling.</p>

<p>Of dramatic literature, between 1550 and 1600, we have
many Italian plays by Groto, Decio da Orto, and Tasso.
The pastoral drama originating with Agostino Beccari
in 1554, reached its highest perfection in Tasso's "Aminta,"
which was followed by Guarini's "Pastor Fido."</p>

<p>Lope de Vega is the great Spanish dramatist of this
time. His astonishing facility produced over two thousand
original dramas, of which three hundred have been
preserved. Jodelle, the father of the French theatre,
presented his "ClÃ©opatre" in 1552. In 1598 the foundations
were laid of the ComÃ©die FranÃ§aise.</p>

<p>In England, Sackville led the way with his tragedy of
"Gorboduc," played at Whitehall before Elizabeth in
1562. In 1576, the first public theatre was erected in
Blackfriars. Several young men of talent appeared,
Marlowe, Peele, Greene, Kyd, and Nash, as the precursors
of Shakespeare; and in 1587, being then twenty-three
years old, the greatest of dramatists settled in
London, and several of his plays had been acted before
the close of the century.</p>

<p>Among English prose writings of this time may be
mentioned Ascham's "Schoolmaster," 1570, Puttenham's
"Art of English Poesie," 1586, and, as a curiosity of
affectation, Lilly's "Euphues." But the first good prose-writer
is Sir Philip Sidney, whose "Arcadia" appeared
in 1590; and the finest master of prose in the Elizabethan
period is Hooker. The first book of the "Ecclesiastical
Polity" is one of the masterpieces of English
eloquence.</p>

<h4><i>V.&mdash;The Seventeenth Century (1600&ndash;1650)</i></h4>

<p>The two great figures in philosophy of this period are
Bacon and Descartes. At its beginning the higher
philosophy had been little benefited by the labours of
any modern enquirer. It was become, indeed, no strange
thing to question the authority of Aristotle, but his disciples
could point with scorn at the endeavours made to
supplant it.</p>

<p>In the great field of natural jurisprudence, the most
eminent name in this period is that of Hugo Grotius,
whose famous work "De Jure Belli et Pacis" was published
in Paris in 1625. This treatise made an epoch in
the philosophical, and, we might almost say, in the political
history of Europe.</p>

<p>In the history of poetry, between 1600 and 1650, we
have the Italians Marini, Tassoni, and Chiabrera, the
last being the founder of a school of lyric poetry known
as "Pindaric." Among Spanish poets are Villegas and
Gongora; in France, Malherbe, Regnier, Racan, Maynard,
Voiture, and Sarrazin; Opitz, in Germany, was
the founder of German poetic literature; and this, the
golden age of Dutch literature, included the poets
Spiegel, Hooft, Cats, and Vondel. The English poets
of these fifty years are very numerous, but for the most
part not well known. Spenser was imitated by Phineas
and Giles Fletcher. Sir John Denham, Donne, Crashaw,
Cowley, Daniel, Michael Drayton, William Browne, and
Sir William Davenant wrote at this time, to which also
belong the sonnets of Shakespeare. Drummond of Hawthornden,
Carew, Ben Jonson, Wither, Habington, Suckling,
and Herrick, were all in the first half of the seventeenth
century. John Milton was born in 1609, and in
1634 wrote "Comus," which was published in 1637;
"Lycidas," the "Allegro" and "Penseroso," the "Ode
on the Nativity," and Milton's sonnets followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
The Italian drama was weak at this period, but in
Spain Lope de Vega and Calderon were at the height of
their glory. In France, Corneille's "MÃ©lite," his first
play, was produced in 1629, and was followed by
"Clitandre," "La Veuve," "Medea," "Cid," and others.
The English drama was exceedingly popular, and the
reigns of James and Charles were the glory of our
theatre. Shakespeare&mdash;the greatest name in all literature&mdash;Ben
Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, Massinger,
Shirley, Heywood, Webster, and many other dramatists
contributed to its fame.</p>

<p>In prose writings, Italian and Spanish works of this
time show a great decline in taste; but in France, the
letters of the moralist Balzac and of Voiture, from 1625,
have ingenuity and sprightliness. English prose writings
of the period include the works of Knolles, Raleigh,
Daniel, Bacon, Milton, Clarendon; Burton's "Anatomy
of Melancholy," Earle's "Microcosmographia" and
Overbury's "Characters."</p>

<p>Fiction was represented by "Don Quixote," of which
the first part was published in 1605&mdash;almost the only
Spanish book which is popularly read in every country;
by the French heroic romance, and by the English
Godwin's "Man in the Moon."</p>

<h4><i>VI.&mdash;The Seventeenth Century (1650&ndash;1700)</i></h4>

<p>Among the greatest writers of this period are Bossuet
and Pascal, in theology; Gassendi, Malebranche, Spinoza,
and Locke, in philosophy; and Cumberland, Puffendorf,
La Rochefoucauld, and La BruyÃ¨re, in morals. Leibnitz
wrote on jurisprudence before he passed on to philosophy,
and the same subject was treated also by Godefroy,
Domat, and Noodt.</p>

<p>Italian poetry had now improved in tone. Filicaja, a
man of serious and noble spirit, wrote odes of deep patriotic
and religious feeling. Guidi, a native of Pavia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
raised himself to the highest point that any lyric poet of
Italy has attained. Spain and Portugal were destitute of
poets; but in France La Fontaine, Boileau, Benserade,
Chaulieu, Segrais, DeshouliÃ¨res, and Fontenelle, were
famous. In England at this time there were Waller,
Milton, Butler, and Dryden, as well as Marvell and other
minor poets.</p>

<p>Neither Italy nor Spain was now producing dramatic
works of any importance, but it was very different in
France. Corneille continued to write for the stage, and
Racine's first play, the "Andromaque," was presented in
1667. This was followed by "Britannicus," "BÃ©rÃ©nice,"
"Mithridate," "IphigÃ©nie," and others. Racine's style is
exquisite; he is second only to Virgil among all poets.
MoliÃ¨re, the French writer whom his country has most
uniformly admired, began with "L'Ã‰tourdi" in 1653, and
his pieces followed rapidly until his death, in 1673. The
English Restoration stage was held by Dryden, Otway,
Southern, Lee, Congreve, Wycherley, Farquhar, and
Vanbrugh.</p>

<p>In prose literature Italy is deficient; but this period
includes the most distinguished portion of the great age
in France, the reign of Louis XIV. Bossuet, Malebranche,
Arnauld, and Pascal are among the greatest of
French writers.</p>

<p>English writing now became easier and more idiomatic,
sometimes even to the point of vulgarity. The best masters
of prose were Cowley, Evelyn, Dryden, and Walton
in the "Complete Angler."</p>

<p>Among novels of the period may be named those of
Quevedo in Spain; of Scarron, Bergerac, Perrault, and
Hamilton, in France; and the "Pilgrim's Progress"&mdash;for
John Bunyan may pass for the father of our novelists&mdash;in
England. Swift's "Tale of a Tub," than which
Rabelais has nothing superior, was indeed not published
till 1704, but was written within the seventeenth century.</p>

<h3>Lectures on the English Poets</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>William Hazlitt, critic and essayist, was born on April 10,
1778, and was educated in London for the Unitarian ministry.
But his talents for painting and for writing diverted him from
that career, and soon, though he showed great promise as a
painter, he devoted himself to authorship, contributing largely
to the "Morning Chronicle," the "Examiner," and the "Edinburgh
Review." His wide, genial interests, his ardent temperament,
and his admirable style, have given Hazlitt a high place
among English critics. He is no pedant or bookworm; he is
always human, always a man of the world. His "Characters
of Shakespeare's Plays," 1817, gave him a reputation which was
confirmed by his "Lectures on the English Poets," delivered
next year at the Surrey Institute. Further lectures, on the English
comic writers and on the Elizabethan dramatists, followed.
His essays, on all kinds of subjects, are collected in volumes
under various titles. All are the best of reading. Hazlitt's later
works include "Liber Amoris," 1823; "Spirit of the Age," 1825,
consisting of character studies; and the "Life of Napoleon"
(Hazlitt's hero), 1828&ndash;30. The essayist was twice married, and
died on September 18, 1830.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>What Is Poetry?</i></h4>

<p>The best general notion which I can give of poetry is
that it is the natural impression of any object or event
by its vividness exciting an involuntary movement of
imagination and passion, and producing, by sympathy, a
certain modulation of the voice or sounds expressing it.
Poetry is the universal language which the heart holds
with Nature and itself. He who has a contempt for
poetry cannot have much respect for himself or for
anything else. It is not a mere frivolous accomplishment;
it has been the study and delight of mankind in
all ages.</p>

<p>Nor is it found only in books; wherever there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
sense of beauty, or power, or harmony, as in a wave of
the sea, or in the growth of a flower, there is poetry in its
birth. It is not a branch of authorship; it is the "stuff
of which our life is made." The rest is "mere oblivion,"
for all that is worth remembering in life is the poetry
of it. If poetry is a dream, the business of life is much
the same. If it is a fiction, made up of what we wish
things to be, and fancy that they are because we wish
them so, there is no other or better reality.</p>

<p>The light of poetry is not only a direct, but also a
reflected light, that, while it shows us the object, throws
a sparkling radiance on all around it; the flame of the
passions communicated to the imagination reveals to
us, as with a flash of lightning, the inmost recesses of
thought, and penetrates our whole being. Poetry represents
forms chiefly as they suggest other forms; feelings,
as they suggest forms, or other feelings. Poetry puts a
spirit of life and motion into the universe. It describes
the flowing, not the fixed. The poetical impression of
any object is that uneasy, exquisite sense of beauty or
power that cannot be contained within itself, that is impatient
of all limit; that&mdash;as flame bends to flame&mdash;strives
to link itself to some other image of kindred beauty or
grandeur, to enshrine itself, as it were, in the highest
forms of fancy, and to relieve the aching sense of pleasure
by expressing it in the boldest manner, and by the
most striking examples of the same quality in other
instances.</p>

<p>As in describing natural objects poetry impregnates
sensible impressions with the forms of fancy, so it
describes the feelings of pleasure or pain by blending
them with the strongest movements of passion and the
most striking forms of Nature. Tragic poetry, which is
the most impassioned species of it, strives to carry on
the feeling to the utmost point of sublimity or pathos
by all the force of comparison or contrast, loses the sense
of present suffering in the imaginary exaggeration of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
exhausts the terror or pity by an unlimited indulgence
of it, and lifts us from the depths of woe to the highest
contemplations of human life.</p>

<p>The use and end of poetry, "both at the first and now,
was and is to hold the mirror up to Nature," seen
through the medium of passion and imagination, not
divested of that medium by means of literal truth or
abstract reason. Those who would dispel the illusions of
imagination, to give us their drab-coloured creation in
their stead, are not very wise. It cannot be concealed,
however, that the progress of knowledge and refinement
has a tendency to clip the wings of poetry. The province
of the imagination is principally visionary, the unknown
and undefined; we can only fancy what we do not know.
There can never be another Jacob's dream. Since that
time the heavens have gone farther off, and grown astronomical.</p>

<p>Poetry combines the ordinary use of language with
musical expression. As there are certain sounds that
excite certain movements, and the song and dance go
together, so there are, no doubt, certain thoughts that
lead to certain tones of voice, or modulations of sound.
The jerks, the breaks, the inequalities and harshnesses of
prose are fatal to the flow of a poetical imagination, as
a jolting road disturbs the reverie of an absent-minded
man. But poetry makes these odds all even. The musical
in sound is the sustained and continuous; the musical
in thought is the sustained and continuous also. An
excuse may be made for rhyme in the same manner.</p>

<h4><i>Chaucer and Spenser</i></h4>

<p>These are two out of the four greatest English poets;
but they were both much indebted to the early poets of
Italy, and may be considered as belonging, in some
degree, to that school. Spenser delighted in luxurious
enjoyment; Chaucer in severe activity of mind. Spenser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
was the most romantic and visionary of all great poets;
Chaucer the most practical, the most a man of business
and the world.</p>

<p>Chaucer does not affect to show his power over the
reader's mind, but the power which his subject has over
his own. The readers of Chaucer's poetry feel more
nearly what the persons he describes must have felt, than
perhaps those of any other poet. There is no artificial,
pompous display; but a strict parsimony of the poet's
materials, like the rude simplicity of the age in which
he lived. His words point as an index to the objects,
like the eye or finger. There were none of the commonplaces
of poetic diction in his time, no reflected lights of
fancy, no borrowed roseate tints; he was obliged to
inspect things narrowly for himself, so that his descriptions
produce the effect of sculpture.</p>

<p>His descriptions of natural scenery possess a characteristic
excellence which may be termed gusto. They
have a local truth and freshness which give the very
feeling of the air, the coolness or moisture of the ground.
Inanimate objects are thus made to have a fellow-feeling
in the interest of the story, and render the sentiment of
the speaker's mind.</p>

<p>It was the same trust in Nature and reliance on his
subject which enabled Chaucer to describe the grief and
patience of Griselda and the faith of Constance. Chaucer
has more of this deep, internal, sustained sentiment than
any other writer, except Boccaccio. In depth of simple
pathos and intensity of conception, never swerving from
his subject, I think no other writer comes near him, not
even the Greek tragedians.</p>

<p>The poetry of Chaucer has a religious sanctity about
it, connected with the manners and superstitions of the
age. It has all the spirit of martyrdom. It has also all
the extravagance and the utmost licentiousness of comic
humour, equally arising out of the manners of the time.
He excelled in both styles, and could pass at will from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
the one to the other; but he never confounded the two
styles together.</p>

<p>Of all the poets, Spenser is the most poetical. There
is an originality, richness, and variety in his allegorical
personages and fictions which almost vie with the splendours
of the ancient mythology. His poetry is all fairyland;
he paints Nature not as we find it, but as we
expected to find it, and fulfils the delightful promise of
our youth. His ideas, indeed, seem more distinct than
his perceptions. The love of beauty, however, and not
of truth, is the moving principle of his mind; and he is
guided in his fantastic delineations by no rule but the
impulse of an inexhaustible imagination.</p>

<p>Some people will say that Spenser's poetry may be
very fine, but that they cannot understand it, on account
of the allegory. They are afraid of the allegory. This is
very idle. If they do not meddle with the allegory, the
allegory will not meddle with them. Without minding it
at all, the whole is as plain as a pikestaff.</p>

<p>Spenser is the poet of our waking dreams, and he has
invented not only a language, but a music of his own for
them. The undulations are infinite, like those of the
waves of the sea; but the effect is still the same, lulling
the senses into a deep oblivion of the jarring noises of
the world, from which we have no wish ever to be
recalled.</p>

<h4><i>Shakespeare and Milton</i></h4>

<p>Those arts which depend on individual genius and
incommunicable power have always leaped at once from
infancy to manhood, from the first rude dawn of invention
to their meridian height and dazzling lustre, and
have in general declined ever after. Homer, Chaucer,
Spenser, Shakespeare, Dante, and Ariosto&mdash;Milton alone
was of a later age, and not the worse for it&mdash;Raphael,
Titian, Michael Angelo, Correggio, Cervantes, and Boccaccio,
the Greek sculptors and tragedians, all lived near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
the beginning of their arts, perfected, and all but created
them. They rose by clusters, never so to rise again.</p>

<p>The four greatest names in English poetry are almost
the four first we come to&mdash;Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare,
and Milton. There are no others that can really
be put into competition with these. Of these four,
Chaucer excels as the poet of manners, or of real life;
Spenser as the poet of romance; Shakespeare as the poet
of Nature, in the largest use of the term; and Milton as
the poet of morality. Chaucer describes things as they
are; Spenser, as we wish them to be; Shakespeare, as
they would be; and Milton, as they ought to be. The
characteristic of Chaucer is intensity; of Spenser, remoteness;
of Milton, elevation; of Shakespeare, everything.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of Shakespeare's mind was its generic
quality; its power of communication with all other minds,
so that it contained a universe of thought and feeling
within itself. He was just like any other man, but
he was like all other men. He was the least of an egotist
that it was possible to be. He was nothing in himself;
but he was all that others were, or that they could become.
His genius shone equally on the evil and on the good, on
the wise and the foolish, the monarch and the beggar.
The world of spirits lay open to him, like the world of
real men and women; and there is the same truth in his
delineations of the one as of the other. Each of his
characters is as much itself, and as absolutely independent
of the rest, as well as of the author, as if they were
living persons, not fictions of the mind. His plays alone
are properly expressions of the passions, not descriptions
of them.</p>

<p>Chaucer's characters are narrative; Shakespeare's,
dramatic; Milton's, epic. In Chaucer we perceive a fixed
essence of character. In Shakespeare there is a continual
composition and decomposition of its elements, a
fermentation of every particle in the whole mass, by its
alternate affinity or antipathy to other principles which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
are brought in contact with it. Milton took only a few
simple principles of character, and raised them to the
utmost conceivable grandeur.</p>

<p>The passion in Shakespeare is full of dramatic fluctuation.
In Chaucer it is like the course of a river&mdash;strong,
full, and increasing; but in Shakespeare it is like the sea,
agitated this way and that, and loud-lashed by furious
storms. Milton, on the other hand, takes only the imaginative
part of passion, that which remains after the event,
and abstracts it from the world of action to that of contemplation.</p>

<p>The great fault of a modern school of poetry [the
Lake poets] is that it would reduce poetry to a mere
effusion of natural sensibility; or, what is worse, would
divest it both of imaginary splendour and human passion,
to surround the meanest objects with the morbid feelings
and devouring egotism of the writers' own minds. Milton
and Shakespeare did not so understand poetry. They
gave a more liberal interpretation both to Nature and art.
They did not do all they could to get rid of the one and
the other, to fill up the dreary void with the moods of
their own minds.</p>

<p>Shakespeare's imagination is of the same plastic kind
as his conception of character or passion. Its movement
is rapid and devious, and unites the most opposite
extremes. He seems always hurrying from his subject,
even while describing it; but the stroke, like the lightning's,
is as sure as it is sudden. His language and versification
are like the rest of him. He has a magic power
over words; they come winged at his bidding, and seem
to know their places. His language is hieroglyphical. It
translates thoughts into visible images. He had an equal
genius for comedy and tragedy; and his tragedies are
better than his comedies, because tragedy is better than
comedy. His female characters are the finest in the
world. Lastly, Shakespeare was the least of a coxcomb
of anyone that ever lived, and much of a gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Shakespeare discovers in his writings little religious
enthusiasm, and an indifference to personal reputation;
in these respects, as in every other, he formed a direct
contrast to Milton. Milton's works are a perpetual invocation
to the muses, a hymn to Fame. He had his
thoughts constantly fixed on the contemplation of the
Hebrew theocracy, and of a perfect commonwealth; and
he seized the pen with a hand warm from the touch of
the ark of faith. The spirit of the poet, the patriot, and
the prophet vied with each other in his breast. He
thought of nobler forms and nobler things than those he
found about him. He strives hard to say the finest
things in the world, and he does say them. In Milton
there is always an appearance of effort; in Shakespeare,
scarcely any.</p>

<p>Milton has borrowed more than any other writer, and
exhausted every source of imitation; yet he is perfectly
distinct from every other writer. The power of his mind
is stamped on every line. He describes objects of which
he could only have read in books with the vividness of
actual observation.</p>

<p>Milton's blank verse is the only blank verse in the language,
except Shakespeare's, that deserves the name of
verse. The sound of his lines is moulded into the expression
of the sentiment, almost of the very image.</p>

<h4><i>Dryden and Pope</i></h4>

<p>These are the great masters of the artificial style of
poetry, as the four poets of whom I have already treated
were of the natural, and they have produced a kind and
degree of excellence which existed equally nowhere else.</p>

<p>Pope was a man of exquisite faculties and of the most
refined taste; he was a wit and critic, a man of sense,
of observation, and the world. He was the poet not of
Nature, but of art. He saw Nature only dressed by art;
he judged of beauty by fashion; he sought for truth in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
the opinions of the world; he judged of the feelings of
others by his own. His muse never wandered with safety
but from his library to his grotto, or from his grotto into
his library back again. That which was the nearest to
him was the greatest; the fashion of the day bore sway
in his mind over the immutable laws of Nature. He had
none of the enthusiasm of poetry; he was in poetry what
the sceptic is in religion. Yet within this narrow circle
how much, and that how exquisite, was contained! The
wrong end of the magnifier is held to everything, but still
the exhibition is highly curious. If I had to choose, there
are one or two persons&mdash;and but one or two&mdash;that I
should like to have been better than Pope!</p>

<p>Dryden was a bolder and more various versifier than
Pope; he had greater strength of mind, but he had not
the same delicacy of feeling. Pope describes the thing,
and goes on describing his own descriptions, till he loses
himself in verbal repetitions; Dryden recurs to the object
often, and gives us new strokes of character as well as of
his pencil.</p>

<h4><i>Thomson and Cowper</i></h4>

<p>Thomson is the best of our descriptive poets; the
colours with which he paints still seem wet. Nature in
his descriptions is seen growing around us, fresh and
lusty as in itself. He puts his heart into his subject, and
it is for this reason that he is the most popular of all
our poets. But his verse is heavy and monotonous; it
seems always labouring uphill.</p>

<p>Cowper had some advantages over Thomson, particularly
in simplicity of style, in a certain precision of
graphical description, and in a more careful choice of
topics. But there is an effeminacy about him which
shrinks from and repels common and hearty sympathy.
He shakes hands with Nature with a pair of fashionable
gloves on; he is delicate to fastidiousness, and glad to
get back to the drawing-room and the ladies, the sofa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
and the tea-urn. He was a nervous man; but to be a
coward is not the way to succeed either in poetry, in war,
or in love. Still, he is a genuine poet, and deserves his
reputation.</p>

<h4><i>Robert Burns</i></h4>

<p>Burns was not like Shakespeare in the range of his
genius; but there is something of the same magnanimity,
directness, and unaffected character about him. He was
as much of a man, not a twentieth part as much of a
poet, as Shakespeare. He had an eye to see, a heart to
feel&mdash;no more. His pictures of good fellowship, of social
glee, of quaint humour, are equal to anything; they come
up to Nature, and they cannot go beyond it. His strength
is not greater than his weakness; his virtues were greater
than his vices. His virtues belonged to his genius; his
vices to his situation.</p>

<p>Nothing could surpass Burns's love-songs in beauty of
expression and in true pathos, except some of the old
Scottish ballads themselves. There is in these a still
more original cast of thought, a more romantic imagery;
a closer intimacy with Nature, a more infantine simplicity
of manners, a greater strength of affection, "thoughts
that often lie too deep for tears." The old English ballads
are of a gayer turn. They are adventurous and
romantic; but they relate chiefly to good living and good
fellowship, to drinking and hunting scenes.</p>

<h4><i>Some Contemporary Poets</i></h4>

<p>Tom Moore is heedless, gay, and prodigal of his poetical
wealth. Everything lives, moves, and sparkles in his
poetry, while, over all, love waves his purple light. His
levity at last oppresses; his variety cloys, his rapidity
dazzles and distracts the sight.</p>

<p>Lord Byron's poetry is as morbid as Moore's is careless
and dissipated. His passion is always of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
unaccountable character, at once violent and sullen, fierce
and gloomy. It is the passion of a mind preying upon
itself, and disgusted with, or indifferent to, all other
things. There is nothing less poetical or more repulsive.
But still there is power; and power forces admiration.
In vigour of style and force of conception he surpasses
every writer of the present day.</p>

<p>Walter Scott is deservedly the most popular of living
poets. He differs from his readers only in a greater
range of knowledge and facility of expression. The
force of his mind is picturesque rather than moral. He
is to the great poet what an excellent mimic is to a
great actor.</p>

<p>Mr. Wordsworth is the most original poet now living.
His poetry is not external, but internal; he furnishes it
from his own mind, and is his own subject. He is the
poet of mere sentiment. Many of the "Lyrical Ballads"
are of inconceivable beauty, of perfect originality and
pathos. But his powers have been mistaken by the age.
He cannot form a whole. He has not the constructive
faculty. His "Excursion" is a proof of this; the line
labours, the sentiment moves slowly, but the poem stands
stock-still.</p>

<p>The Lake school of poetry had its origin in the French
Revolution, or rather in the sentiments and opinions
which produced that event. The world was to be turned
topsy-turvy, and poetry was to share its fate. The paradox
they set out with was that all things are by Nature
equally fit subjects for poetry, or rather, that the meanest
and most unpromising are best. They aimed at exciting
attention by reversing the established standards of
estimation in the world. An adept in this school of
poetry is jealous of all excellence but his own. He is
slow to admire anything admirable, feels no interest in
what is most interesting to others, no grandeur in anything
grand. He sees nothing but himself and the universe.
His egotism is, in some respects, a madness. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
effect of this has been perceived as something odd; but
the cause or principle has never been traced to its source
before. The proofs are to be found throughout many
of the poems of Mr. Southey, Mr. Coleridge, and
Mr. Wordsworth.</p>

<p>I may say of Mr. Coleridge that he is the only person
I ever knew who answered to the idea of a man of genius.
But his "Ancient Mariner" is the only work that
gives an adequate idea of his natural powers. In it,
however, he seems to "conceive of poetry but as a
drunken dream, reckless, careless, and heedless of past,
present, and to come."</p>

<p>I have thus gone through my task. I have felt my
subject sinking from under me as I advanced, and have
been afraid of ending in nothing. The interest has
unavoidably decreased at almost every step of the progress,
like a play that has its catastrophe in the first or
second act. This, however, I could not help.</p>

<h3>The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>In 1857 Oliver Wendell Holmes (see Vol. V, p. 87) leapt into
fame by his "Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table" papers in the
"Atlantic Monthly," then edited by Lowell. His "Professor"
and "Poet" series of papers followed, with hardly less success.
In these writings a robust idealism, humour, fancy, and tenderness
are so gently mixed as to amount to genius.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>Every Man His Own Boswell</i></h4>

<p>"All generous minds have a horror of what are commonly
called 'facts.' They are the brute beasts of the
intellectual domain. Who does not know fellows that
always have an ill-conditioned fact or two that they lead
after them into decent company like so many bulldogs,
ready to let them slip at every ingenious suggestion, or
convenient generalisation, or pleasant fancy? I allow
no 'facts' at this table."</p>

<p>I continued, for I was in the talking vein, "This business
of conversation is a very serious matter. There are
men that it weakens one to talk with an hour more than
a day's fasting would do. They are the talkers that have
what may be called jerky minds. After a jolting half-hour
with one of these jerky companions talking with a
dull friend affords great relief. It is like taking the cat
in your lap after holding a squirrel."</p>

<p>"Do not dull people bore you?" said one of the lady
boarders.</p>

<p>"Madam," said I, "all men are bores except when
we want them. Talking is like playing on the harp; there
is as much in laying the hand on the strings to stop the
vibrations as in twanging them to bring out the music.
There is this, too, about talking," I continued; "it shapes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
our thoughts for us; the waves of conversation roll them
as the surf rolls the pebbles on the shore. Writing or
printing is like shooting with a rifle; you may hit your
reader's mind, or miss it, but talking is like playing at a
mark with the pipe of an engine&mdash;if it is within reach,
and you have time enough, you can't help hitting it."</p>

<p>The company agreed that this last illustration was of
superior excellence.</p>

<h4><i>The Ageing of Ideas</i></h4>

<p>"I want to make a literary confession now, which I
believe nobody has made before me. I never wrote a
'good' line in my life, but the moment after it was written
it seemed a hundred years old. The rapidity with
which ideas grow old in our memories is in a direct ratio
to the squares of their importance. A great calamity,
for instance, is as old as the trilobites an hour after it
has happened. It stains backward through all the leaves
we have turned over in the book of life, before its blot
of tears or of blood is dry on the page we are turning."</p>

<p>I wish I had not said all this then and there. The pale
schoolmistress, in her mourning dress, was looking at me
with a wild sort of expression; and all at once she melted
away from her seat like an image of snow; a sling shot
could not have brought her down better. God forgive
me!</p>

<h4><i>The Confusion of Personality</i></h4>

<p>"We must remember that talking is one of the fine
arts&mdash;the noblest, the most important, and the most difficult.
It is not easy at the best for two persons talking
together to make the most of each other's thoughts, there
are so many of them."</p>

<p>The company looked as if they wanted an explanation.</p>

<p>"When John and Thomas, for instance, are talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
together," I continued, "it is natural that among the six
there should be more or less confusion and misapprehension."</p>

<p>Our landlady turned pale. No doubt she thought there
was a screw loose in my intellect, and that it involved the
probable loss of a boarder. Everybody looked up, and
the old gentleman opposite slid the carving-knife to one
side, as it were, carelessly.</p>

<p>"I think," I said, "I can make it plain that there are
at least six personalities distinctly to be recognised as
taking part in that dialogue between John and Thomas.</p>

<h5>THREE JOHNS</h5>

<blockquote>

<p>1. The real John; known only to his Maker.</p>

<p>2. John's ideal John; never the real one, and often
very unlike him.</p>

<p>3. Thomas's ideal John; never the real John, nor John's
John, but often very unlike either.</p></blockquote>

<h5>THREE THOMASES</h5>

<blockquote>

<p>1. The real Thomas.</p>

<p>2. Thomas's ideal Thomas.</p>

<p>3. John's ideal Thomas.</p></blockquote>

<p>"It follows that until a man can be found who knows
himself as his Maker knows him, or who sees himself
as others see him, there must be at least six persons engaged
in every dialogue between two. No wonder two
disputants often get angry when there are six of them
talking and listening all at the same time."</p>

<p>A very unphilosophical application of the above remarks
was made by a young fellow, answering to the
name of John, who sits near me at table. A certain
basket of peaches, a rare vegetable, little known to
boarding-houses, was on its way to me <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">viÃ¢</i> this unlettered
Johannes. He appropriated the three that remained in
the basket, remarking that there was just one apiece for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
him. I convinced him that his practical inference was
hasty and illogical&mdash;but in the meantime he had eaten the
peaches.</p>

<h4><i>More on Books</i></h4>

<p>"Some of you boarders ask me why I don't write a
novel, or something of that kind. Well, there are several
reasons against it. In the first place I should tell all my
secrets, and I maintain that verse is the proper medium
for such revelations. Again, I am terribly afraid I
should show up all my friends, and I am afraid all my
friends would not bear showing up very well. And
sometimes I have thought I might be too dull to write
such a story as I should wish to write. And, finally, I
think it is very likely I <em>shall</em> write a story one of these
days.</p>

<p>"I saw you smiled when I spoke about the possibility
of my being too dull to write a good story. When one
arrives at the full and final conclusion that he or she is
really dull, it is one of the most tranquillising and blessed
convictions that can enter a mortal's mind.</p>

<p>"How sweetly and honestly one said to me the other
day, 'I hate books!' I did not recognise in him inferiority
of literary taste half so distinctly as I did simplicity
of character, and fearless acknowledgment of his
inaptitude for scholarship. In fact, I think there are a
great many who read, with a mark to keep their place,
that really 'hate books,' but never had the wit to find it
out, or the manliness to own it."</p>

<h4><i>Dual Consciousness</i></h4>

<p>I am so pleased with my boarding-house that I intend
to remain here, perhaps for years.</p>

<p>"Do thoughts have regular cycles? Take this: All at
once a conviction flashes through us that we have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
in the same precise circumstances as at the present instant
once or many times before."</p>

<p>When I mentioned this the Schoolmistress said she
knew the feeling well, and didn't like to experience it;
it made her think she was a ghost, sometimes.</p>

<p>The young fellow whom they call John said he knew
all about it. He had just lighted a cheroot the other day
when a tremendous conviction came over him that he
had done just that same thing ever so many times
before.</p>

<p>"How do I account for it? Well, some think that one
of the hemispheres of the brain hangs fire, and the small
interval between the perceptions of the nimble and the
sluggish half seems an indefinitely long period, and
therefore the second perception appears to be the copy
of another, ever so old."</p>

<h4><i>The Race of Life</i></h4>

<p>"Nothing strikes one more in the race of life than to
see how many give out in the first half of the course.
'Commencement day' always reminds me of the start
of the 'Derby.' Here we are at Cambridge and a class
is first 'graduating.' Poor Harry! he was to have been
there, but he has paid forfeit.</p>

<p>"<i>Ten years gone.</i> First turn in the race. A few
broken down; two or three bolted. 'Cassock,' a black
colt, seems to be ahead of the rest. 'Meteor' has pulled
up.</p>

<p>"<i>Twenty years.</i> Second corner turned. 'Cassock'
has dropped from the front, and 'Judex,' an iron-grey,
has the lead. But look! how they have thinned out!
Down flat&mdash;five&mdash;six&mdash;how many? They will not get up
again in this race be very sure!</p>

<p>"<i>Thirty years.</i> Third corner turned. 'Dives,' bright
sorrel, ridden by the fellow in a yellow jacket, begins to
make play fast&mdash;is getting to be the favourite with many.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
But who is that other one that now shows close up to
the front? Don't you remember the quiet brown colt
'Asteroid,' with the star in his forehead? That is he;
he is one of the sort that lasts. 'Cassock' is now taking
it easily in a gentle trot.</p>

<p>"<i>Forty years.</i> More dropping off, but places much as
before.</p>

<p>"<i>Fifty years.</i> Race over. All that are on the course
are coming in at a walk; no more running. Who is
ahead? Ahead? What! and the winning-post a slab of
white or gray stone standing out from that turf where
there is no more jockeying, or straining for victory!
Well, the world marks their places in its betting-book;
but be sure that these matter very little, if they have
run as well as they knew how!</p>

<p>"I will read you a few lines, if you do not object,
suggested by looking at a section of one of those chambered
shells to which is given the name of Pearly
Nautilus.</p>

<h4><i>Sensibility and Scholarship</i></h4>

<p>"Every person's feelings have a front-door and a side-door
by which they may be entered. The front-door is
on the street. The side-door opens at once into the
sacred chambers. There is almost always at least one
key to this side-door. This is carried for years hidden
in a mother's bosom. Be very careful to whom you
entrust one of these keys of the side-door. Some of
those who come in at the side-door have a scale of your
whole nervous system, and can play on all the gamut of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
your sensibilities in semi-tones. Married life is the
school in which the most accomplished artists in this
department are found. Be very careful to whom you
give the side-door key.</p>

<p>"The world's great men have not commonly been
great scholars, nor its great scholars great men. The
Hebrew patriarchs had small libraries, if any; yet they
represent to our imaginations a very complete idea of
manhood, and I think if we could ask Abraham to dine
with us men of letters next Saturday we should feel
honoured by his company."</p>

<h4><i>A Growing Romance</i></h4>

<p>"I should like to make a few intimate revelations relating
especially to my early life, if I thought you would
like to hear them."</p>

<p>The schoolmistress turned in her chair and said, "If
we should <em>like</em> to hear them&mdash;we should <em>love</em> to."</p>

<p>So I drew my chair a shade nearer her, and went on
to speak of voices that had bewitched me.</p>

<p>"I wish you could hear my sister's voice," said the
schoolmistress.</p>

<p>"If it is like yours it must be a pleasant one," said I.</p>

<p>Lately she has been walking early and has brought
back roses in her cheeks. I love the damask rose best
of all flowers.</p>

<p>Our talk had been of trees, and I had been comparing
the American and the English elms in the walk we call
the Mall. "Will you walk out and look at those elms with
me after breakfast?" I said to the schoolmistress.</p>

<p>I am not going to tell lies about it, and say that she
blushed. On the contrary, she turned a little bit pale,
but smiled brightly, and said, "Yes, with pleasure." So
she went to fetch her bonnet, and the old gentleman
opposite followed her with his eyes, and said he wished
he was a young fellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
"This is the shortest way," she said, as we came to the
corner.</p>

<p>"Then we won't take it," said I.</p>

<p>When we reached the school-room door the damask
roses were so much heightened in colour by exercise that
I felt sure it would be useful to her to take a stroll like
this every morning.</p>

<p>I have been low-spirited and listless lately. It is coffee,
I think. I notice that I tell my secrets too easily when
I am downhearted. There are inscriptions on our hearts
never seen except at dead low-tide. And there is a
woman's footstep on the sand at the side of my deepest
ocean-buried inscription.</p>

<p>I am not going to say which I like best, the seashore
or the mountains. The one where your place is, is the
best for you; but this difference there is&mdash;you can
domesticate mountains. The sea is feline. It licks your
feet, its huge flanks purr very pleasantly for you; but it
will crack your bones and eat you for all that, and wipe
the crimsoned foam from its jaws as if nothing had
happened. The mountains have a grand, stupid, lovable
tranquillity; the sea has a fascinating, treacherous intelligence.</p>

<p>"If I thought I should ever see the Alps!" said the
schoolmistress.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you might some time or other," I said.</p>

<p>"It is not very likely," she answered.</p>

<p><i>Tableau.</i> Chamouni. Mont Blanc in full view. Figures
in the foreground, two of them standing apart; one
of them a gentleman&mdash;oh&mdash;ah&mdash;yes!&mdash;the other a lady,
leaning on his shoulder. (The reader will understand
this was an internal, private, subjective diorama, seen for
one instant on the background of my own consciousness.)</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I can't say just how many walks she and I had taken
together. I found the effect of going out every morning
was decidedly favourable on her health. I am afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
I did the greater part of the talking. Better too few
words from the woman we love than too many; while
she is silent, Nature is working for her; while she talks
she works for herself. Love is sparingly soluble in the
words of men, therefore they speak much of it; but one
syllable of woman's speech can dissolve more of it than
a man's heart can hold.</p>

<h4><i>Nature's Patient Advance</i></h4>

<p>I don't know anything sweeter than the leaking in of
Nature through all the cracks in the walls and floors of
cities. You heap a million tons of hewn rocks on a
square mile or so of earth which was green once. The
trees look down from the hill-tops and ask each other,
as they stand on tiptoe, "What are these people about?"
And the small herbs look up and whisper back, "We
will go and see." So the small herbs pack themselves
up in the least possible bundles, and wait until the night
wind steals to them and whispers, "Come with me."
Then they go softly with it into the great city&mdash;one to a
cleft in the pavement, one to a spout on the roof, one to
a seam in the marble over a rich gentleman's bones, and
one to the grave without a stone, where nothing but a
man is buried&mdash;and there they grow, looking down on
the generations of men from mouldy roofs, looking up
from between the less-trodden pavements, looking out
through iron cemetery railings.</p>

<p>Listen to them when there is only a light breath stirring,
and you will hear them saying to each other, "Wait
awhile." The words run along the telegraph of those
narrow green lines that border the roads leading from
the city, until they reach the slope of the hills, and the
trees repeat in low murmurs, "Wait awhile." By and
by the flow of life in the streets ebbs, and the old leafy
inhabitants&mdash;the smaller tribes always in front&mdash;saunter
in, one by one, very careless seemingly, but very tenacious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
until they swarm so that the great stones gape
from each other with the crowding of their roots, and
the feldspar begins to be picked out of the granite to find
them food. At last the trees take up their solemn line
of march, and never rest until they have camped in the
market-place. Wait long enough, and you will find an
old doting oak hugging in its yellow underground arms
a huge worn block that was the cornerstone of the State-house.
Oh, so patient she is, this imperturbable Nature!</p>

<h4><i>The Long Path</i></h4>

<p>It was in talking of life that the schoolmistress and I
came nearest together. I thought I knew something
about that. The schoolmistress had tried life, too. Once
in a while one meets with a single soul greater than all
the living pageant that passes before it. This was one
of them. Fortune had left her, sorrow had baptised her.
Yet as I looked upon her tranquil face, gradually regaining
a cheerfulness that was often sprightly, as she became
interested in the various matters we talked about
and places we visited, I saw that eye and lip and every
shifting lineament were made for love.</p>

<p>I never addressed a word of love to the schoolmistress
in the course of these pleasant walks. It seemed as if we
talked of everything but love on that particular morning.
There was, perhaps, a little more timidity and hesitancy
on my part than I have commonly shown among our
people at the boarding-house. In fact, I considered myself
the master at the breakfast-table; but somehow I
could not command myself just then so well as usual.
The truth is, I had secured a passage to Liverpool in the
steamer which was to leave at noon&mdash;with the condition
of being released if circumstances occurred to detain me.
The schoolmistress knew nothing about this, of course,
as yet.</p>

<p>It was on the Common that we were walking. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
boulevard of the Common, you know, has various
branches leading from it in different directions. One of
these runs across the whole length of the Common. We
called it the "long path," and were fond of it.</p>

<p>I felt very weak indeed&mdash;though of a tolerably robust
habit&mdash;as we came opposite to the head of this path on
that morning. I think I tried to speak twice, without
making myself distinctly audible. At last I got out the
question, "Will you take the long path with me?"
"Certainly," said the schoolmistress, "with much pleasure."
"Think," I said, "before you answer. If you
take the long path with me now, I shall interpret it that
we are to part no more."</p>

<p>The schoolmistress stepped back with a sudden movement,
as if an arrow had struck her. One of the long
granite blocks used as seats was hard by&mdash;the one you
may still see close by the gingko-tree. "Pray sit down,"
I said.</p>

<p>"No, no," she answered softly; "I will walk the <em>long
path</em> with you!"</p>

<p>The old gentleman who sits opposite met us walking,
arm-in-arm, about the middle of the long path, and said
very charmingly to us, "Good-morning, my dears!"</p>

<h3>Characters</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Jean de la BruyÃ¨re was born in Paris, in August, 1645. He
studied law and became a barrister, but at the age of twenty-eight
gave up that profession, which did not agree with his
tendencies to meditation and his scrupulous mind. In 1673, he
bought the office of Treasurer of the Finances, and led an independent
and studious life. In 1684, he became a tutor to the
Duc de Bourbon, grandson of the great CondÃ©, and continued
to reside in the CondÃ© household until his death in 1696. In
the "CaractÃ¨res," which first appeared in 1688, La BruyÃ¨re
has recorded his impressions of men. In 1687 the manuscript
was handed to Michallet, a publisher in whose shop La BruyÃ¨re
spent many hours every week. "Will you print this?" asked
the author. "I don't know whether it will be to your advantage;
but should it prove a success, the money will be for my dear
friend, your little daughter." The sale of the book produced
over $40,000. When La BruyÃ¨re was elected a member of the
French Academy, his enemies declared that the "Characters"
consisted of satirical portraits of leading personalities, and
"keys" to the portraits were widely circulated. The pen
sketches, however, are not only applicable to that period, but to
every age.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;On Men and Books</i></h4>

<p>All has been said, and one comes too late after the
seven thousand years during which men have existed&mdash;and
thought. All that one can do is to think and speak
rightly, without attempting to force one's tastes and feelings
upon others.</p>

<p>Mediocrity in poetry, music, painting, and oratory is
unbearable.</p>

<p>There is in art a certain degree of perfection, as there
is in Nature an ideal point of matureness. To go beyond,
or to remain below that degree is faulty.</p>

<p>The ability of a writer consists mainly in giving good
definitions and apt descriptions. The superiority of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Moses, Homer, Plato, Virgil, and Horace resides in the
beauty of their expressions and images. One has to express
the truth to write in a natural, powerful, and refined
manner.</p>

<p>It has taken centuries for men to return to the ideal of
the ancients and to all that is simple and natural.</p>

<p>We feed on the classics and the able, modern authors.
Then, when we become authors ourselves, we ill-use our
masters, like those children who, strengthened by the
milk they have suckled, beat their nurses.</p>

<p>Read your works to those who are able to criticise and
appreciate them. A good and careful writer often finds
that the expression he had so long looked for was most
simple and natural, and one which ought to have occurred
to him at once and without effort.</p>

<p>The pleasure there is in criticising takes from us the
joy of being moved by that which is really beautiful.</p>

<p>ArsÃ¨ne, from the top of his mind, looks down upon
humanity; and, owing to the distance from which he sees
men, is almost frightened at their smallness. He is so
filled with his own sublime thoughts that he hardly finds
time to deliver a few precious oracles.</p>

<p>ThÃ©ocrine knows things which are rather useless; his
ideas are always strange, his memory always at work.
He is a supercilious dreamer, and always seems to laugh
at those whom he considers as his inferiors. I read my
book to him; he listens. Afterwards, he speaks to me
about his own book. What does he think of mine? I
told you so before: he speaks to me of his own work!</p>

<p>What an amazing difference there is between a beautiful
book and a perfect book!</p>

<p>When a book elevates your mind, and inspires you with
noble thoughts, you require nothing else to judge it; it is
a good and masterly work.</p>

<p>The fools do not understand what they read. The
mediocre think they understand thoroughly. Great
minds do not always understand every page of a book;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
they think obscure that which is obscure, and clear that
which is clear. The pedantic find obscure that which is
not, and refuse to understand that which is perfectly
clear.</p>

<p>MoliÃ¨re would have been a perfect writer had he only
avoided jargon and barbarisms, and written more purely.</p>

<p>Ronsard had in him enough good and bad to form
great disciples in prose and verse.</p>

<p>Corneille, at his best, is original and inimitable, but he
is uneven. He had a sublime mind, and has written a
few verses which are among the best ever written.</p>

<p>Racine is more human. He has imitated the Greek
classics, and in his tragedies there is simplicity, clearness,
and pathos.</p>

<p>Corneille paints men as they ought to be; Racine paints
them as they are. Corneille is more moral; Racine is
more natural. The former, it seems, owes much to Sophocles;
the latter, to Euripides.</p>

<p>How is it that people at the theatre laugh so freely, and
yet are ashamed to weep? Is it less natural to be moved
by all that is worthy of pity than to burst out laughing
at all that is ridiculous? Is it that we consider it weak
to cry, especially when the cause of our emotion is an
artificial one? But the cause of our laughter at the
theatre is also artificial. Some persons think it is as
childish to laugh excessively as to sob.</p>

<p>Not only should plays not be immoral; they should be
elevating.</p>

<p>Logic is the art of convincing oneself of some truth.
Eloquence is a gift of the soul which makes one capable
of conquering the hearts and minds of the listeners and
of making them believe anything one pleases.</p>

<p>He who pays attention only to the taste of his own
century thinks more of himself than of his writings.
One should always aim at perfection. If our contemporaries
fail to do us justice, posterity may do so.</p>

<p>Horace and Boileau have said all this before. I take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
your word for it; but may I not, after them, "think a
true thought," which others will think after me?</p>

<p>There are more tools than workers, and among the
latter, more bad than good ones.</p>

<p>There is, in this world, no task more painful than that
of making a name for oneself; we die before having even
sketched our work. It takes, in France, much firmness
of purpose and much broadmindedness to be indifferent
to public functions and offices, and to consent to remain
at home and do nothing.</p>

<p>Hardly anyone has enough merit to assume that part
in a dignified manner, or enough brains to fill the gap of
time without what is generally called business.</p>

<p>All that is required is a better name for idleness; and
that meditation, conversation, reading, and repose should
be called work.</p>

<p>You tell me that there is gold sparkling on PhilÃ©mon's
clothes. So there is on the clothes at the draper's. He
is covered with the most gorgeous fabrics. I can see
those fabrics in the shops. But the embroidery and
ornaments on PhilÃ©mon's clothes further increase their
magnificence. If so, I praise the embroiderer's workmanship.
If someone asks him the time, he takes from
his pocket a jewelled watch; the hilt of his sword is made
of onyx; he displays a dazzling diamond on his finger
and wears all the curious and pretty trifles of fashion and
vanity. You arouse my interest at last. I ought to see
those precious things. Send me the clothes and jewels
of PhilÃ©mon; I don't require to see <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>It is difficult to tell the hero from the great man at
war. Both have military virtues. However, the former
is generally young, enterprising, gifted, self-controlled
even in danger, and courageous; the latter has much judgment,
foresees events, and is endowed with much ability
and experience. Perhaps one might say that Alexander
was only a hero and that CÃ¦sar was a great man.</p>

<p>MÃ©nippe is a bird adorned with feathers which are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
his own. He has nothing to say; he has no feelings, no
thoughts. He repeats what others have said, and uses
their ideas so instinctively that he deceives himself, and
is his first victim. He often believes that he is expressing
his own thoughts, while he is only an echo of someone
whom he has just left. He believes childishly that
the amount of wit he possesses is all that man ever possessed.
He therefore looks like a man who has nothing
to desire.</p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;On Women and Wealth</i></h4>

<p>From the age of thirteen to the age of twenty-one, a
girl wishes she were beautiful; afterwards she wishes
she were a man.</p>

<p>An unfaithful woman is a woman who has ceased to
love.</p>

<p>A light-hearted woman is a woman who already loves
another.</p>

<p>A fickle woman is a woman who does not know
whether she loves or not, and who does not know what
or whom she loves.</p>

<p>An indifferent woman is a woman who loves nothing.</p>

<p>There is a false modesty which is vanity; a false glory
which is light-mindedness; a false greatness which is
smallness; a false virtue which is hypocrisy; a false
wisdom which is prudishness.</p>

<p>Why make men responsible for the fact that women
are ignorant? Have any laws or decrees been issued
forbidding them to open their eyes, to read, to remember
what they have read, and to show that they understood
it in their conversations and their works? Have they
not themselves decided to know little or nothing, because
of their physical weakness, or the sluggishness of their
minds; because of the time their beauty requires; because
of their light-mindedness which prevents them from
studying; because they have only talent and genius for
needlework or house-managing; or because they instinctively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
dislike all that is earnest and demands some
effort?</p>

<p>Women go to extremes. They are better or worse
than men.</p>

<p>Women go farther than men in love; but men make
better friends.</p>

<p>It is because of men that women dislike one another.</p>

<p>It is nothing for a woman to say what she does not
mean; it is easier still for a man to say all what he thinks.</p>

<p>Time strengthens the ties of friendship and loosens
those of love.</p>

<p>There is less distance between hatred and love than
between dislike and love.</p>

<p>One can no more decide to love for ever than decide
never to love at all.</p>

<p>One comes across men who irritate one by their
ridiculous expressions, the strangeness and unfitness of
the words they use. Their weird jargon becomes to them
a natural language. They are delighted with themselves
and their wit. True, they have some wit, but one pities
them for having so little of it; and, what is more, one
suffers from it.</p>

<p>Arrias has read and seen everything, and he wants
people to know it. He is a universal man; he prefers to
lie rather than keep silent or appear ignorant about something.
The subject of the conversation is the court of a
certain northern country. He at once starts talking, and
speaks of it as if he had been born in that country; he
gives details on the manners and customs, the women
and the laws: he tells anecdotes and laughs loudly at his
own wit. Someone ventures to contradict him and
proves to him that he is not accurate in his statements.
Arrias turns to the interrupter: "I am telling nothing
that is not exact," he says. "I heard all those details
from Sethon, ambassador of France to that court.
Sethon returned recently; I know him well, and had a
long conversation with him on this matter." Arrias was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
resuming his story with more confidence than ever, when
one of the guests said to him: "I am Sethon, and have
just returned from my mission."</p>

<p>ClÃ©ante is a most honest man. His wife is the most
reasonable person in the world. Both make everybody
happy wherever they go, and it were impossible to find
a more delightful and refined couple. Yet they separate
to-morrow!</p>

<p>At thirty you think about making your fortune; at
fifty you have not made it; when you are old, you start
building, and you die while the painters are still at work.</p>

<p>Numberless persons ruin themselves by gambling, and
tell you coolly they cannot live without gambling. What
nonsense! Would it be allowed to say that one cannot
live without stealing, murdering, or leading a riotous
existence?</p>

<p>Giton has a fresh complexion, and an aggressive expression.
He is broad-shouldered and corpulent. He
speaks with confidence. He blows his nose noisily, spits
to a great distance, and sneezes loudly. He sleeps a
great deal, and snores whenever he pleases. When he
takes a walk with his equals he occupies the centre; when
he stops, they stop; when he advances again, they do the
same. No one ever interrupts him. He is jovial, impatient,
haughty, irritable, independent. He believes
himself witty and gifted. He is rich.</p>

<p>PhÃ©don has sunken eyes. He is thin, and his cheeks
are hollow. He sleeps very little. He is a dreamer, and,
although witty, looks stupid. He forgets to say what he
knows, and when he does speak, speaks badly. He
shares the opinion of others; he runs, he flies to oblige
anyone; he is kind and flattering. He is superstitious,
scrupulous, and bashful. He walks stealthily, speaks in
a low voice, and takes no room. He can glide through
the densest crowd without effort. He coughs, and blows
his nose inside his hat, and waits to sneeze until he is
alone. He is poor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;On Men and Manners</i></h4>

<p>Paris is divided into a number of small societies which
are like so many republics. They have their own customs,
laws, language, and even their own jokes.</p>

<p>One grows up, in towns, in a gross ignorance of all
that concerns the country. City-bred men are unable to
tell hemp from flax, and wheat from rye. We are satisfied
as long as we can feed and dress.</p>

<p>When we speak well of a man at court, we invariably
do so for two reasons: firstly, in order that he may hear
that we spoke well of him; secondly, in order that he
may speak well of us in his turn.</p>

<p>To be successful and to secure high offices there are
two ways: the high-road, on which most people pass;
and the cross-road, which is the shorter.</p>

<p>The youth of a prince is the origin of many fortunes.</p>

<p>Court is where joys are evident, but artificial; where
sorrows are concealed, but real.</p>

<p>A slave has one master; an ambitious man has as many
as there are persons who may be useful to him in his
career.</p>

<p>With five or six art terms, people give themselves out
as experts in music, painting, and architecture.</p>

<p>The high opinions people have of the great and mighty
is so blind, and their interest in their gestures, features,
and manners so general, that if the mighty were only
good, the devotion of the people to them would amount
to worship.</p>

<p>Lucile prefers to waste his life as the protÃ©gÃ© of a
few aristocrats than to live on familiar terms with his
peers.</p>

<p>It is advisable to say nothing of the mighty. If you
speak well of them, it is flattery. It is dangerous to
speak ill of them during their lifetime, and it is cowardly
to do so after they are dead.</p>

<p>Life is short and annoying. We spend life wishing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
When life is wretched, it is hard to bear; when it is
happy, it is dreadful to lose it. The one alternative is as
bad as the other.</p>

<p>Death occurs only once, but makes itself felt at every
moment of our life. It is more painful to fear it than
to suffer it.</p>

<p>There are but three events for man: birth, life, and
death. He does not realise his birth, he suffers when he
dies, and he forgets to live.</p>

<p>We seek our happiness outside ourselves. We seek it
in the opinions of men whom we know are flatterers, and
who lack sincerity. What folly! Most men spend half
their lives making the other half miserable.</p>

<p>It is easier for many men to acquire one thousand
virtues than to get rid of one defect.</p>

<p>It is as difficult to find a conceited man who believes
himself really happy as to discover a modest man who
thinks himself too unhappy.</p>

<p>The birch is necessary to children. Grown-up men
need a crown, a sceptre, velvet caps and fur-lined robes.
Reason and justice devoid of ornaments would not be
imposing or convincing. Man, who is a mind, is led by
his eyes and his ears!</p>

<h4><i>IV.&mdash;On Customs and Religion</i></h4>

<p>Fashion in matters of food, health, taste and conscience
is utterly foolish. Game is at present out of fashion, and
condemned as a food. It is to-day a sin against fashion
to be cured of the ague by blood-letting.</p>

<p>The conceited man thinks every day of the way in
which he will be able to attract attention on the following
day. The philosopher leaves the matter of his clothes
to his tailor. It is just as childish to avoid fashion as to
follow its decrees too closely.</p>

<p>Fashion exists in the domain of religion.</p>

<p>There have been young ladies who were virtuous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
healthy and pious, who wished to enter a convent, but
who were not rich enough to take in a wealthy abbey the
vows of poverty.</p>

<p>How many men one sees who are strong and righteous,
who would never listen to the entreaties of their friends,
but who are easily influenced and corrupted by women.</p>

<p>I would like to hear a sober, moderate, chaste, righteous
man declare that there is no God. At least he would be
speaking in a disinterested manner. But there is no
such man to be found.</p>

<p>The fact that I am unable to prove that God does not
exist establishes for me the fact that God does exist.</p>

<p>Atheism does not exist. If there were real atheists,
it would merely prove that there are monsters in this
world.</p>

<p>Forty years ago I didn't exist, and it was not within
my power to be born. It does not depend upon me who
now exist to be no more. Consequently, I began being
and am going on being, thanks to something which is
beyond me, which will last after me, which is mightier
than I am. If that something is not God, pray tell me
what it is.</p>

<p>Everything is great and worthy of admiration in
Nature.</p>

<p>O you vain and conceited man, make one of these
worms which you despise! You loathe toads; make a
toad if you can!</p>

<p>Kings, monarchs, potentates, sacred majesties, have I
given you all your supreme names? We, mere men, require
some rain for our crops or even some dew; make
some dew, send to the earth a drop of water!</p>

<p>A certain inequality in the destinies of men, which
maintains order and obedience, is the work of God. It
suggests a divine law.</p>

<p>If the reader does not care for these "characters," it
will surprise me; if he does care for them, it will also
surprise me.</p>

<h3>Imaginary Conversations</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Walter Savage Landor, writer, scholar, poet, and, it might almost
be said, quarreller, said of his own fame, "I shall dine late,
but the dining-room will be well lighted, the guests few and
select." A powerful, turbulent spirit, he attracted great men.
Emerson, Browning, Dickens, and Swinburne travelled to sit at
his feet, and he knew Byron, Shelley, Wordsworth, Lamb, and
Southey. Born at Warwick, on January 30, 1775, he was dismissed
from Rugby School at the age of fifteen, and from Oxford
at the age of nineteen; was estranged from his father;
several times left the wife whom he had married for her golden
hair, and spent the last years of his life, lonely but lionised, at
Florence. To the last&mdash;which came on September 17, 1864&mdash;he
wrote both prose and verse. Landor appears, to the average
appreciator of English literature, an interesting personality
rather than a great writer, though his epic, "Gebir" (1798), and
his tragedy, "Count Julian" (1812), like some of his minor
verse, contain passages of great beauty. But it was in the
"Imaginary Conversations," written between 1821 and 1829, and
first sampled by the public in review form in 1823, that he endowed
the English language with his most permanent achievement.
Nearly 150 of these "Conversations" were written in all,
and we epitomise here five of the best-known.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;Peter the Great and Alexis</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span>: And so, after flying from thy father's house,
thou hast returned again from Vienna. After this affront
in the face of Europe, thou darest to appear before me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexis</span>: My emperor and father! I am brought before
your majesty not at my own desire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span>: I believe it well. What hope hast thou, rebel,
in thy flight to Vienna?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexis</span>: The hope of peace and privacy; the hope of
security, and, above all things, of never more offending
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span>: Didst thou take money?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Alexis</span>: A few gold pieces. Hitherto your liberality,
my father, hath supplied my wants of every kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span>: Not of wisdom, not of duty, not of spirit, not
of courage, not of ambition. I have educated thee among
my guards and horses, among my drums and trumpets,
among my flags and masts. I have rolled cannon balls
before thee over iron plates; I have shown thee bright
new arms, bayonets, and sabres. I have myself led thee
forth to the window when fellows were hanged and shot;
and I have made thee, in spite of thee, look steadfastly
upon them, incorrigible coward! Thy intention, I know,
is to subvert the institutions it has been the labour of my
lifetime to establish. Thou hast never rejoiced at my
victories.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexis</span>: I have rejoiced at your happiness and your
safety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span>: Liar! Coward! Traitor! When the Polanders
and the Swedes fell before me, didst thou congratulate
me? Didst thou praise the Lord of Hosts? Wert
thou not silent and civil and low-spirited?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexis</span>: I lamented the irretrievable loss of human
life, I lamented that the bravest and noblest were swept
away the first, that order was succeeded by confusion,
and that your majesty was destroying the glorious plans
you alone were capable of devising.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span>: Of what plans art thou speaking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexis</span>: Of civilising the Muscovites. The Polanders
in parts were civilised; the Swedes more than any other
nation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span>: Civilised, forsooth? Why the robes of the
metropolitan, him at Upsal, are not worth three ducats.
But I am wasting my words. Thine are tenets that strike
at the root of politeness and sound government.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexis</span>: When I hear the God of Mercy invoked to
massacres, and thanked for furthering what He reprobates
and condemns&mdash;I look back in vain on any barbarous
people for worse barbarism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Peter</span>: Malignant atheist! Am I Czar of Muscovy,
and hear discourse on reason and religion&mdash;from my own
son, too? No, by the Holy Trinity! thou art no son of
mine. Unnatural brute, I have no more to do with thee.
Ho there! Chancellor! What! Come at last! Wert
napping, or counting thy ducats?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chancellor</span>: Your majesty's will, and pleasure!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span>: Is the senate assembled?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chancellor</span>: Every member, sire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span>: Conduct this youth with thee, and let them
judge him; thou understandest?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chancellor</span>: Your majesty's commands are the breath
of our nostrils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span>: If these rascals are amiss, I will try my new
cargo of Livonian hemp upon 'em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chancellor</span> (<i>returning</i>): Sire! Sire!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span>: Speak, fellow! Surely they have not condemned
him to death without giving themselves time to
read the accusation, that thou comest back so quickly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chancellor</span>: No, sire! Nor has either been done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span>: Then thy head quits thy shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chancellor</span>: O sire! he fell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span>: Tie him up to thy chair, then. Cowardly beast!
What made him fall?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chancellor</span>: The hand of death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span>: Prythee speak plainlier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chancellor</span>: He said calmly, but not without sighing
twice or thrice, "Lead me to the scaffold; I am weary of
life. My father says, too truly, I am not courageous, but
the death that leads me to my God shall never terrify me."
When he heard your majesty's name accusing him of
treason and attempts at parricide, he fell speechless. We
raised him up: he was dead!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span>: Inconsiderate and barbarous varlet as thou art,
dost thou recite this ill accident to a father&mdash;and to one
who has not dined? Bring me a glass of brandy. Away
and bring it: scamper! Hark ye! bring the bottle with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
it: and&mdash;hark ye! a rasher of bacon on thy life! and some
pickled sturgeon, and some krout and caviar.</p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;Joseph Scaliger and Montaigne</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Montaigne</span>: What could have brought you, M. de
l'Escale, other than a good heart? You rise early, I see;
you must have risen with the sun, to be here at this hour.
I have capital white wine, and the best cheese in Auvergne.
Pierre, thou hast done well; set it upon the table, and tell
Master Matthew to split a couple of chickens and broil
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scaliger</span>: This, I perceive, is the ante-chamber to your
library; here are your every-day books.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montaigne</span>: Faith! I have no other. These are
plenty, methinks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scaliger</span>: You have great resources within yourself,
and therefore can do with fewer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montaigne</span>: Why, how many now do you think here
may be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scaliger</span>: I did not believe at first that there could be
above fourscore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montaigne</span>: Well! are fourscore few? Are we talking
of peas and beans?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scaliger</span>: I and my father (put together) have written
well-nigh as many.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montaigne</span>: Ah! to write them is quite another thing.
How do you like my wine? If you prefer your own country
wine, only say it. I have several bottles in my cellar.
I do not know, M. de l'Escale, whether you are particular
in these matters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scaliger</span>: I know three things&mdash;wine, poetry, and the
world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montaigne</span>: You know one too many, then. I hardly
know whether I know anything about poetry; for I like
Clem Marot better than Ronsard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scaliger</span>: It pleases me greatly that you like Marot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
His version of the Psalms is lately set to music, and added
to the New Testament of Geneva.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montaigne</span>: It is putting a slice of honeycomb into a
barrel of vinegar, which will never grow the sweeter for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scaliger</span>: Surely, you do not think in this fashion of
the New Testament?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montaigne</span>: Who supposes it? Whatever is mild and
kindly is there. But Jack Calvin has thrown bird-lime
and vitriol upon it, and whoever but touches the cover
dirties his fingers or burns them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scaliger</span>: Calvin is a very great man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montaigne</span>: I do not like your great men who beckon
me to them, call me their begotten, their dear child, and
their entrails; and, if I happen to say on any occasion,
"I beg leave, sir, to dissent a little from you," stamp and
cry, "The devil you do!" and whistle to the executioner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scaliger</span>: John Calvin is a grave man, orderly, and
reasonable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montaigne</span>: In my opinion he has not the order nor
the reason of my cook. Mat never twitched God by the
sleeve and swore He should not have his own way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scaliger</span>: M. de Montaigne, have you ever studied the
doctrine of predestination?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montaigne</span>: I should not understand it if I had; and
I would not break through an old fence merely to get into
a cavern. Would it make me honester or happier, or, in
other things, wiser?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scaliger</span>: I do not know whether it would materially.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montaigne</span>: I should be an egregious fool, then, to
care about it. Come, walk about with me; after a ride
you can do nothing better to take off fatigue. I can show
you nothing but my house and my dairy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scaliger</span>: Permit me to look a little at those banners.
They remind me of my own family, we being descended
from the great Cane della Scala, Prince of Verona, and
from the House of Hapsburg, as you must have heard
from my father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Montaigne</span>: What signifies it to the world whether
the great Cane was tied to his grandmother or not? As
for the House of Hapsburg, if you could put together as
many such houses as would make up a city larger than
Cairo, they would not be worth his study, or a sheet of
paper on the table of it.</p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;Bossuet and the Duchesse de Fontanges</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Bossuet</span>: Mademoiselle, it is the king's desire that I
compliment you on the elevation you have attained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fontanges</span>: O monseigneur, I know very well what
you mean. His majesty is kind and polite to everybody.
The last thing he said to me was, "AngÃ©lique! do not
forget to compliment monseigneur the bishop on the dignity
I have conferred upon him, of almoner to the dauphiness.
I desired the appointment for him only that he
might be of rank sufficient to confess you, now you are
duchess." You are so agreeable a man, monseigneur, I
will confess to you, directly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bossuet</span>: Have you brought yourself to a proper frame
of mind, young lady?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fontanges</span>: What is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bossuet</span>: Do you hate sin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fontanges</span>: Very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bossuet</span>: Do you hate the world?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fontanges</span>: A good deal of it; all Picardy, for example,
and all Sologne; nothing is uglier&mdash;and, oh my life!
what frightful men and women!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bossuet</span>: I would say in plain language, do you hate
the flesh and the devil?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fontanges</span>: Who does not hate the devil? If you will
hold my hand the while, I will tell him so&mdash;"I hate you,
beast!" There now. As for flesh, I never could bear a
fat man. Such people can neither dance nor hunt, nor do
anything that I know of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bossuet</span>: Mademoiselle Marie AngÃ©lique de Scoraille<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
de Rousille, Duchesse de Fontanges! Do you hate titles,
and dignities, and yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fontanges</span>: Myself! Does anyone hate me? Why
should I be the first? Hatred is the worst thing in the
world; it makes one so very ugly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bossuet</span>: We must detest our bodies if we would save
our souls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fontanges</span>: That is hard. How can I do it? I see
nothing so detestable in mine. Do you? As God hath
not hated me, why should I? As for titles and dignities,
I am glad to be a duchess. Would not you rather be a
duchess than a waiting-maid if the king gave you your
choice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bossuet</span>: Pardon me, mademoiselle. I am confounded
at the levity of your question. If you really have anything
to confess, and desire that I should have the honour of
absolving you, it would be better to proceed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fontanges</span>: You must first direct me, monseigneur.
I have nothing particular. What was it that dropped on
the floor as you were speaking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bossuet</span>: Leave it there!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fontanges</span>: Your ring fell from your hand, my lord
bishop! How quick you are! Could not you have trusted
me to pick it up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bossuet</span>: Madame is too condescending. My hand is
shrivelled; the ring has ceased to fit it. A pebble has
moved you more than my words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fontanges</span>: It pleases me vastly. I admire rubies. I
will ask the king for one exactly like it. This is the time
he usually comes from the chase. I am sorry you cannot
be present to hear how prettily I shall ask him. I am sure
he will order the ring for me, and I will confess to you
with it upon my finger. But, first, I must be cautious and
particular to know of him how much it is his royal will
that I should say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>

<h4><i>IV.&mdash;The Empress Catharine and Princess Dashkof</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Catharine</span>: Into his heart! Into his heart! If he
escapes, we perish! Do you think, Dashkof, they can
hear me through the double door? Yes, hark! they heard
me. They have done it! What bubbling and gurgling!
He groaned but once. Listen! His blood is busier now
than it ever was before. I should not have thought it
could have splashed so loud upon the floor. Put you ear
against the lock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dashkof</span>: I hear nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catharine</span>: My ears are quicker than yours, and know
these notes better. Let me come. There! There again!
The drops are now like lead. How now? Which of
these fools has brought his dog with him? What trampling
and lapping! The creature will carry the marks all
about the palace with his feet! You turn pale, and tremble.
You should have supported me, in case I had required
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dashkof</span>: I thought only of the tyrant. Neither in
life nor in death could any one of these miscreants make
me tremble. But the husband slain by his wife! What
will Russia&mdash;what will Europe say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catharine</span>: Russia has no more voice than a whale.
She may toss about in her turbulence, but my artillery
(for now, indeed, I can safely call it mine) shall stun and
quiet her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dashkof</span>: I fear for your renown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catharine</span>: Europe shall be informed of my reasons,
if she should ever find out that I countenanced the conspiracy.
She shall be persuaded that her repose made the
step necessary; that my own life was in danger; that I
fell upon my knees to soften the conspirators; that only
when I had fainted, the horrible deed was done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dashkof</span>: Europe may be more easily subjugated than
duped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Catharine</span>: She shall be both, God willing! Is the
rouge off my face?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dashkof</span>: It is rather in streaks and mottles, excepting
just under the eyes, where it sits as it should do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catharine</span>: I am heated and thirsty. I cannot imagine
how. I think we have not yet taken our coffee. I
could eat only a slice of melon at breakfast&mdash;my duty
urged me <em>then</em>&mdash;and dinner is yet to come. Remember, I
am to faint at the midst of it, when the intelligence comes
in, or, rather, when, in despite of every effort to conceal it
from me, the awful truth has flashed upon my mind.
Remember, too, you are to catch me, and to cry for help,
and to tear those fine flaxen hairs which we laid up
together on the toilet; and we are both to be as inconsolable
as we can be for the life of us.</p>

<p>Come, sing. I know not how to fill up the interval.
Two long hours yet! How stupid and tiresome! I wish
all things of the sort could be done and be over in a day.
They are mightily disagreeable when by nature one is not
cruel. People little know my character. I have the tenderest
heart upon earth. Ivan must follow next; he is
heir to the throne. But not now. Another time. Two
such scenes together, and without some interlude, would
perplex people.</p>

<p>I thought we spoke of singing. Do not make me wait.
Cannot you sing as usual, without smoothing your dove's
throat with your handkerchief, and taking off your necklace?
Sing, sing! I am quite impatient!</p>

<h4><i>V.&mdash;Bacon and Richard Hooker</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Bacon</span>: Hearing much of your worthiness and wisdom,
Master Richard Hooker, I have besought your comfort
and consolation in this my too heavy affliction, for we
often do stand in need of hearing what we know full well,
and our own balsams must be poured into our breasts by
another's hand. Withdrawn, as you live, from court and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
courtly men, and having ears occupied by better reports
than such as are flying about me, yet haply so hard a case
as mine, befalling a man heretofore not averse from the
studies in which you take delight, may have touched you
with some concern.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hooker</span>: I do think, my lord of Verulam, that the day
which in his wisdom he appointed for your trial was the
very day on which the king's majesty gave unto your
ward and custody the great seal of his English realm.
And&mdash;let me utter it without offence&mdash;your features and
stature were from that day forward no longer what they
were before. Such an effect do rank and power and
office produce even on prudent and religious men. You,
my lord, as befits you, are smitten and contrite; but I
know that there is always a balm which lies uppermost in
these afflictions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bacon</span>: Master Richard, it is surely no small matter to
lose the respect of those who looked up to us for countenance;
and the favour of a right learned king, and, O
Master Hooker, such a power of money! But money is
mere dross. I should always hold it so, if it possessed not
two qualities&mdash;that of making men treat us reverently,
and that of enabling us to help the needy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hooker</span>: The respect, I think, of those who respect
us for what a fool can give and a rogue can take away,
may easily be dispensed with; but it is indeed a high prerogative
to help the needy, and when it pleases the Almighty
to deprive us of it, he hath removed a most fearful
responsibility.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bacon</span>: Methinks it beginneth to rain, Master Richard.
What if we comfort our bodies with a small cup of wine,
against the ill-temper of the air. Pledge me; hither
comes our wine.(<i>To the servant</i>) Dolt! Is not this
the beverage I reserve for myself?</p>

<p>Bear with me, good Master Hooker, but verily I have
little of this wine, and I keep it as a medicine for my many
and growing infirmities. You are healthy at present:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
God, in His infinite mercy, long maintain you so!
Weaker drink is more wholesome for you. But this
Malmsey, this Malmsey, flies from centre to circumference,
and makes youthful blood boil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hooker</span>: Of a truth, my knowledge in such matters is
but sparse. My lord of Canterbury once ordered part of
a goblet, containing some strong Spanish wine, to be
taken to me from his table when I dined by sufferance
with his chaplains, and, although a most discreet, prudent
man, as befitteth his high station, was not so chary of my
health as your lordship. Wine is little to be trifled with;
physic less. The Cretans, the brewers of this Malmsey,
have many aromatic and powerful herbs among them.
On their mountains, and notably on Ida, grows that dittany
which works such marvels, and which perhaps may
give activity to this hot medicinal drink of theirs. I
would not touch it knowingly; an unregarded leaf dropped
into it above the ordinary might add such puissance to the
concoction as almost to break the buckles in my shoes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bacon</span>: When I read of such things I doubt them:
but if I could procure a plant of dittany I would persuade
my apothecary and my gamekeeper to make experiments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hooker</span>: I dare not distrust what grave writers have
declared in matters beyond my knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bacon</span>: Good Master Hooker, I have read many of
your reasonings, and they are admirably well sustained.
Yet forgive me, in God's name my worthy master, if you
descried in me some expression of wonder at your simplicity.
You would define to a hair's breadth the qualities,
states, and dependencies of principalities, dominations,
and powers; you would be unerring about the apostles
and the churches, and 'tis marvellous how you wander
about a pot-herb!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hooker</span>: I know my poor, weak intellects, most noble
lord, and how scantily they have profited by my hard
painstaking. Wisdom consisteth not in knowing many
things, nor even in knowing them thoroughly, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
choosing and in following what conduces the most certainly
to our lasting happiness and true glory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bacon</span>: I have observed among the well-informed and
the ill-informed nearly the same quantity of infirmities
and follies; those who are rather the wiser keep them
separate, and those who are wisest of all keep them better
out of sight. I have persuaded men, and shall persuade
them for ages, that I possess a wide range of thought unexplored
by others, and first thrown open by me, with
many fair enclosures of choice and abstruse knowledge.
One subject, however, hath almost escaped me, and surely
one worth the trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hooker</span>: Pray, my lord, if I am guilty of no indiscretion,
what may it be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bacon</span>: Francis Bacon.</p>

<h3>Reflections and Moral Maxims</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Rochefoucauld's "Reflections, or Sentences and Moral Maxims,"
were published in 1665. In them his philosophy of life
is expressed with a perfection of form which still remains
unrivalled and unequalled. The original work contains only
314 short sentences; the last edition he published contains 541;
but when one examines the exquisite workmanship of his style,
one does not wonder that it represents the labour of twenty
years. La Rochefoucauld (see Vol. X, p. 203) is one of the
greatest masters of French prose, as well as one of the great
masters of cynicism. He has exerted a deep influence both on
English and French literature, and Swift and Byron were among
his disciples.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;Of Love and of Women</i></h4>

<p>To judge love by most of its effects, it seems more like
hatred than kindness.</p>

<p>In love we often doubt of what we most believe.</p>

<p>As long as we love, we forgive.</p>

<p>Love is like fire, it cannot be without continual motion;
as soon as it ceases to hope or fear it ceases to exist.</p>

<p>Many persons would never have been in love had they
never heard talk of it.</p>

<p>Agreeable and pleasant as love is, it pleases more by
the manners in which it shows itself than by itself alone.</p>

<p>We pass on from love to ambition; we seldom return
from ambition to love.</p>

<p>Those who have had a great love affair find themselves
all their life happy and unhappy at being cured of it.</p>

<p>In love the one who is first cured is best cured.</p>

<p>The reason why lovers are never weary of talking of
each other is that they are always talking of themselves.</p>

<p>Constancy in love is a perpetual inconstancy which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
makes our heart attach itself in succession to all the
qualities of our beloved, and prefer, now this trait and
now that; so that this constancy is only a kind of inconstancy
fixed and enclosed in a single object.</p>

<p>If there is a love pure and exempt from all mixture
with our other passions, it is that which is hidden in the
depth of our heart and unknown to ourselves.</p>

<p>The pleasure of love consists in loving, and our own
passion gives us more happiness than the feelings which
our beloved has for us.</p>

<p>The grace of novelty is to love like the fine bloom on
fruit; it gives it a lustre which is easily effaced and never
recovered.</p>

<p>We are nearer loving those who hate us than those
who love us more than we desire.</p>

<p>Women often fancy themselves to be in love when they
are not. Their natural passion for being beloved, their
unwillingness to give a denial, the excitement of mind
produced by an affair of gallantry, all these make them
imagine they are in love when they are in fact only
coquetting.</p>

<p>All women are flirts. Some are restrained by timidity
and some by reason.</p>

<p>The greatest miracle of love is the reformation of a
coquette.</p>

<p>A coquette pretends to be jealous of her lover, in order
to conceal her envy of other women.</p>

<p>Most women yield more from weakness than from passion,
hence an enterprising man usually succeeds with
them better than an amiable man.</p>

<p>It is harder for women to overcome their coquetry
than their love. No woman knows how much of a
coquette she is.</p>

<p>Women who are in love more readily forgive great
indiscretions than small infidelities.</p>

<p>Some people are so full of themselves that even when
they become lovers they find a way of being occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
with their passion without being interested in the person
whom they love.</p>

<p>It is useless to be young without being beautiful, or
beautiful without being young.</p>

<p>In their first love affairs women love their lover; in all
others they love love.</p>

<p>In the old age of love, as in the old age of life, we
continue to live to pain long after we have ceased to live
to pleasure.</p>

<p>There is no passion in which self-love reigns so powerfully
as in love; we are always more ready to sacrifice
the repose of a person we love than to lose our own.</p>

<p>There is a certain kind of love which, as it grows excessive,
leaves no room for jealousy.</p>

<p>Jealousy is born with love, but it does not always die
with it.</p>

<p>Jealousy is the greatest of all afflictions, and that
which least excites pity in the persons that cause it.</p>

<p>In love and in friendship we are often happier by
reason of the things that we do not know than by those
that we do.</p>

<p>There are few women whose merit lasts longer than
their beauty.</p>

<p>The reason why most women are little touched by
friendship is that friendship is insipid to those who have
felt what love is.</p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;Friendship</i></h4>

<p>In the misfortunes of our best friends we always find
something that does not displease us.</p>

<p>Rare as true love is, it is less rare than true friendship.</p>

<p>What makes us so changing in our friendships is that
it is difficult to discern the qualities of the soul, and easy
to recognize the qualities of the mind.</p>

<p>It is equally difficult to have a friendship for those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
whom we do not esteem as for those we esteem more
than ourselves.</p>

<p>We love those who admire us, not those whom we
admire.</p>

<p>Most of the friendships of the world ill deserve the
name of friendship; still, a man may make occasional
use of them, as in a business where the profits are uncertain
and it is usual to be cheated.</p>

<p>It is more dishonourable to mistrust a friend than to
be deceived by him.</p>

<p>We are fond of exaggerating the love our friends bear
us, but it is less from a feeling of gratitude than from
a desire to advertise our own merits.</p>

<p>What usually hinders us from revealing the depths of
our hearts to our friends is not so much the distrust
which we have of them as the distrust that we have of
ourselves.</p>

<p>We confess our little defects merely to persuade our
friends that we have no great failings.</p>

<p>The greatest effort of friendship is not to show our
defects to a friend, but to make him see his own.</p>

<p>Sincerity is an opening of the heart. It is found in
exceedingly few people, and what passes for it is only
a subtle dissimulation used to attract confidence.</p>

<p>We can love nothing except in relation to ourselves,
and we merely follow our own bent and pleasure when
we prefer our friends to ourselves; yet it is only by
this preference that friendship can be made true and
perfect.</p>

<p>It seems as if self-love is the dupe of kindness and
that it is forgotten while we are working for the benefit
of other men. In this case, however, our self-love is
merely taking the safest road to arrive at its ends; it is
lending at usury under the pretext of giving, it is aiming
at winning all the world by subtle and delicate means.</p>

<p>The first impulses of joy excited in us by the good
fortune of our friends proceed neither from our good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
nature nor from the friendship we have for them; it is
an effect of self-love that flatters us with the hope either
of being fortunate in our turn or of drawing some advantage
from their prosperity.</p>

<p>What makes us so eager to form new acquaintances is
not the mere pleasure of change or a weariness of old
friendships, so much as a disgust at not being enough
admired by those who know us too well, and a hope of
winning more admiration from persons who do not know
much about us.</p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;Things of the Mind</i></h4>

<p>The mind is always the dupe of the heart. Those who
are acquainted with their own mind are not acquainted
with their own heart.</p>

<p>The mind is more indolent than the body.</p>

<p>It is the mark of fine intellects to explain many things
in a few words; little minds have the gift of speaking
much and saying nothing.</p>

<p>We speak but little when vanity does not make us
speak.</p>

<p>A spirit of confidence helps on conversation more than
brilliance of mind does.</p>

<p>True eloquence consists of saying all that is necessary,
and nothing more.</p>

<p>A man may be witty and still be a fool; judgment is
the source of wisdom.</p>

<p>A man does not please for very long when he has but
one kind of wit.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to imagine that wit and judgment are
two distinct things; judgment is only the perfection of
wit, which pierces into the recesses of things and there
perceives what from the outside seems to be imperceptible.</p>

<p>A man of intelligence would often be at a loss were it
not for the company of fools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
It is not so much fertility of mind that leads us to
discover many expedients in regard to a single matter, as
a defect of intelligence, that makes us stop at everything
presented to our imagination, and hinders us from discerning
at once which is the best course.</p>

<p>Some old men like to give good advice to console
themselves for being no longer in a state to give a bad
example.</p>

<p>No man of sound good sense strikes us as such unless
he is of our way of thinking.</p>

<p>Stiffness of opinion comes from pettiness of mind;
we do not easily believe in anything that is beyond our
range of vision.</p>

<p>Good taste is based on judgment rather than on intelligence.</p>

<p>It is more often through pride than through any want
of enlightenment that men set themselves stubbornly to
oppose the most current opinions; finding all the best
places taken on the popular side, they do not want those
in the rear.</p>

<p>In order to understand things well one must know the
detail of them; and as this is almost infinite, our knowledge
is always superficial and imperfect.</p>

<p>It is never so difficult to talk well as when we are
ashamed of our silence.</p>

<p>The excessive pleasure we feel in talking about ourselves
ought to make us apprehensive that we afford
little to our listeners.</p>

<p>Truth has not done so much good in the world as the
false appearances of it have done harm.</p>

<p>Man's chief wisdom consists in being sensible of his
follies.</p>

<h4><i>IV.&mdash;Human Life and Human Nature</i></h4>

<p>Youth is a continual intoxication; it is the fever of
reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
The passions of youth are scarcely more opposed to
salvation than the lukewarmness of old persons.</p>

<p>There is not enough material in a fool to make a good
man out of him.</p>

<p>We have more strength than will, and it is often to
excuse ourselves to ourselves that we imagine things are
impossible.</p>

<p>There are few things impossible in themselves; it is
the application to achieve them that we lack more than
the means.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to imagine that only the more violent
passions, such as ambition and love, can triumph over
the rest. Idleness often masters them all. It indeed
influences all our designs and actions, and insensibly
destroys both our vices and our virtues.</p>

<p>Idleness is of all our passions that which is most unknown
to ourselves. It is the most ardent and the most
malign of all, though we do not feel its working, and the
harm which it does is hidden. If we consider its
power attentively, we shall see that in every struggle it
triumphs over our feelings, our interests, and our pleasures.
To give a true idea of this passion it is necessary
to add that idleness is like a beatitude of the soul which
consoles it for all its losses and serves in place of all its
wealth.</p>

<p>The gratitude of most men is only a secret desire to
receive greater favours.</p>

<p>We like better to see those on whom we confer benefits
than those from whom we receive them.</p>

<p>It is less dangerous to do harm to most men than to do
them too much good.</p>

<p>If we had no defects ourselves we should not take so
much pleasure in observing the failings of others.</p>

<p>One man may be more cunning than another man, but
he cannot be more cunning than all the world.</p>

<p>Mankind has made a virtue of moderation in order
to limit the ambition of great men and to console mediocre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
people for their scanty fortune and their scanty
merit.</p>

<p>We should often be ashamed of our finest actions if
the world saw all the motives that produced them.</p>

<p>Our desire to speak of ourselves, and to reveal our
defects in the best light in which we can show them,
constitutes a great part of our sincerity.</p>

<p>The shame that arises from undeserved praise often
leads us to do things which we should not otherwise
have attempted.</p>

<p>The labours of the body free us from the pains of the
mind. It is this that constitutes the happiness of the
poor.</p>

<p>It is more necessary to study men than to study books.</p>

<p>The truly honest man is he who sets no value on himself.</p>

<p>Censorious as the world is, it is oftener favourable to
false merit than unjust to true.</p>

<p>It is not enough to possess great qualities; we must
know how to use them.</p>

<p>He who lives without folly is not so wise as he fancies.</p>

<p>Good manners are the least of all laws and the most
strictly observed.</p>

<p>Everybody complains of a lack of memory, nobody
of a lack of judgment.</p>

<p>The love of justice is nothing more than a fear of
injustice.</p>

<p>Passion often makes a fool of a man of sense, and
sometimes it makes a fool a man of sense.</p>

<p>Nature seems to have hidden in the depth of our
minds a skill and a talent of which we are ignorant; only
our passions are able to bring them out and to give us
sometimes surer and more complete views than we could
arrive at by thought and study.</p>

<p>Our passions are the only orators with an unfailing
power of persuasion. They are an art of nature with
infallible rules, and the simplest man who is possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
by passion is far more persuasive than the most eloquent
speaker who is not moved by feeling.</p>

<p>As we grow old we grow foolish as well as wise.</p>

<p>Few people know how to grow old.</p>

<p>Death and the sun are things one cannot look at
steadily.</p>

<h4><i>V.&mdash;Virtues and Vices</i></h4>

<p>Hypocrisy is a homage that vice pays to virtue.</p>

<p>Our vices are commonly disguised virtues.</p>

<p>Virtue would not go far if vanity did not go with her.</p>

<p>Prosperity is a stronger test of virtue than misfortune
is.</p>

<p>Men blame vice and praise virtue only through self-interest.</p>

<p>Great souls are not those which have less passions and
more virtues than common souls, but those which have
larger ambitions.</p>

<p>Of all our virtues one might say what an Italian poet
has said of the honesty of women, "that it is often
nothing but an art of pretending to be honest."</p>

<p>Virtues are lost in self-interest, as rivers are in the
sea.</p>

<p>To the honour of virtue it must be acknowledged that
the greatest misfortunes befall men from their vices.</p>

<p>When our vices leave us, we flatter ourselves that we
have left them.</p>

<p>Feebleness is more opposed to vice than virtue is.</p>

<p>What makes the pangs of shame and jealousy so
sharp is that our vanity cannot help us to support them.</p>

<p>What makes the vanity of other persons so intolerable
is that it hurts our own.</p>

<p>We have not the courage to say in general that we
have no defects, and that our enemies have no good
qualities; but in matters of detail we are not very far
from believing it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
If we never flattered ourselves the flattery of others
Would not injure us.</p>

<p>We sometimes think we dislike flattery; we only dislike
the way in which we are flattered.</p>

<p>Flattery is a kind of bad money to which our vanity
gives currency.</p>

<p>Self-love, as it happens to be well or ill-conducted,
constitutes virtue and vice.</p>

<p>We are so prepossessed in our own favour that we
often mistake for virtues those vices that bear some
resemblance to them, and are artfully disguised by self-love.</p>

<p>Nothing is so capable of lessening our self-love as the
observation that we disapprove at one time what we
approve at another.</p>

<p>Self-love is the love of self, and of everything for the
sake of self. When fortune gives the means, self-love
makes men idolise themselves and tyrannise over others.
It never rests or fixes itself anywhere outside its home.
If it settle on external things, it is only as the bee does
on flowers, to extract what may be serviceable. Nothing
is so impetuous as its desires, nothing so secret as its
designs, nothing so adroit as its conduct. We can neither
fathom the depth, nor penetrate the obscurity of its
abyss. There, concealed from the most piercing eye,
it makes numberless turnings and windings; there is it
often invisible even to itself; there it conceives, breeds,
and cherishes, without being aware of it, an infinity of
likings and hatreds; some of which are so monstrous
that, having given birth to them, self-love either does not
recognize them, or cannot bear to own them. From the
darkness which covers self-love spring the ridiculous
notions which it entertains of itself; thence its errors,
ignorance, and silly mistakes; thence it imagines that its
feelings are dead when they are but asleep; and thinks
that it has lost all appetite when it is for the moment
sated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
But the thick mist which hides it from itself does not
hinder it from seeing perfectly whatever is without; and
thus it resembles the eye, that sees all things except
itself. In great concerns and important affairs, where
the violence of its desire excites its whole attention, it
sees, perceives, understands, invents, suspects, penetrates,
and divines all things; so that one is tempted to
believe that each of its passions has its peculiar magic.</p>

<p>Its desires are inflamed by itself rather than by the
beauty and merit of the objects; its own taste heightens
and embellishes them; itself is the game it pursues, and
its own inclination is what is followed rather than the
things which seem to be the objects of its inclination.
Composed of contrarieties, it is imperious and obedient,
sincere and hypocritical, merciful and cruel, timid and
bold. Its desires tend, according to the diverse moods
that direct it, sometimes to glory, sometimes to wealth,
sometimes to pleasure. These are changed as age and
experience alter; and whether it has many inclinations
or only one is a matter of indifference, because it can
split itself into many or collect itself into one just as is
convenient or agreeable.</p>

<p>It is inconstant; and numberless are the changes, besides
those which happen from external causes, which
proceed from its own nature. Inconstant through
levity, through love, through novelty, through satiety,
through disgust, through inconstancy itself. Capricious;
and sometimes labouring with eagerness and incredible
pains to obtain things that are in no way advantageous,
nay, even hurtful, but which are pursued merely as a
passion. Whimsical, and often exerting intense application
in the most trifling employments; taking delight in
the most insipid things, and preserving all its haughtiness
in the most contemptible pursuits. Attendant on all
ages and conditions; living everywhere; living on everything;
living on nothing. Easy in either the enjoyment,
or privation of things. Going over to those who are at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
variance with it; even entering into their schemes; and,
wonderful! joining with them, it hates itself; conspires
its own destruction; labours to be undone; desires only
to exist; and, that granted, consents to be its own enemy.</p>

<p>We are not therefore to be surprised if sometimes,
uniting with the most rigid austerity, it enters boldly
into a combination against itself; because what is lost
in one respect is regained in another. When we think
it relinquishes pleasures, it only suspends or changes
them; and even when discomforted, and we seem to be
rid of it, we find it triumphant in its own defeat. Such
is self-love!&mdash;of which man's whole life is only a strong,
a continued agitation. The sea is a striking image of it,
and in the flux and reflux of the waves, self-love may
find a lively expression of the turbulent succession of its
thoughts, and of its eternal agitation.</p>

<h3>Treatise on Painting</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Leonardo Da Vinci was born in 1452 at Anchiano, near Vinci,
in Tuscany, the son of a Florentine notary. Trained in the
workshop of Andrea Verrocchio, he became one of the greatest
and most versatile artists of the Renaissance. Indeed, he must
be considered one of the master-minds of all times, for there
was scarcely a sphere of human knowledge in which he did not
excel and surpass his contemporaries. He was not only preeminent
as painter, sculptor, and architect, but was an accomplished
musician, poet, and improvisatore, an engineer&mdash;able to
construct canals, roads, fortifications, ships, and war-engines of
every description&mdash;an inventor of rare musical instruments, and
a great organiser of fÃªtes and pageants. Few of his artistic
creations have come down to us; but his profound knowledge
of art and science, and the wide range of his intellect are fully
revealed in the scattered leaves of his notebooks, which are now
preserved in the British Museum, the BibliothÃ¨que Nationale in
Paris, the Ambrosiani in Milan, and other collections. The first
edition of the "Treatise on Painting" was a compilation from
these original notes, published at Paris in 1651. Leonardo died
at Cloux on May 2, 1519.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>From Da Vinci's Notebooks</i></h4>

<p>The eye, which is called the window of the soul, is the
principal means whereby our intelligence may most fully
and splendidly comprehend the infinite works of nature;
and the ear comes next, by gaining importance through
hearing the things that have been perceived by the eye.
If you historians or poets, or mathematicians, had not
seen things with your eyes, badly would you describe
them in your writings. If you, O poet, call painting
dumb poetry, the painter might say of the poet's writing
blind painting. Now consider, which taunt is more
mordant&mdash;to be called blind or dumb?</p>

<p>If the poet is as free in invention as the painter, yet
his fiction is not as satisfying to mankind as is painting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
for whereas poetry endeavours with words to represent
forms, actions, and scenes, the painter's business is to
imitate forms with the images of these very forms.
Take the case of a poet, describing the beauties of a
woman to her lover, and that of a painter depicting her;
you will soon see whither nature will attract the enamoured
judge. And should not the proof of things be
the verdict of experience?</p>

<p>If you say that poetry is more enduring, I may reply
that the works of a coppersmith are more enduring still,
since time has preserved them longer than your works
or ours; yet they are less imaginative, and painting, if
done with enamels on copper, can be made far more enduring.
We, in our art, may be said to be grandsons
unto God. If you despise painting, which is the sole
imitator of all the visible works of nature, then you certainly
despise a subtle invention which, with philosophical
and ingenious reflection, considers all the properties
of forms, airs, and scenes, trees, animals, grasses and
flowers, which are surrounded by light and shade.</p>

<p>And this is a science and the true-born daughter of
nature, since painting is born of this self-same nature.
But, in order to speak more correctly, let us call it the
grandchild of nature, because all visible things are produced
by nature, and from these same things is born
painting. Wherefore we may rightly call it the grandchild
of nature, related to God Himself.</p>

<h4><i>How Sculpture is Less Intellectual</i></h4>

<p>Being sculptor no less than painter, and practising both
arts in the same degree, it seems to me that I may without
arrogance pronounce how one of them is more intellectual,
difficult, and perfect than the other.</p>

<p>Firstly, sculpture is subject to a certain light&mdash;namely,
from above&mdash;and painting carries everywhere with it light
and shade. Light and shade are, therefore, the essentials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
in sculpture. In this respect the sculptor is aided
by the nature of the relief, which produces these of its
own accord; the painter introduces them by his art
where nature would reasonably place them. The sculptor
cannot reproduce the varying nature of the colours
of objects; painting lacks nothing in this respect. The
sculptor's perspectives never seem true, but the painter's
lead the eye hundreds of miles into the work. Aerial
perspective is alien to their work. They can neither
represent transparent nor luminous bodies, neither reflected
rays nor shiny surfaces like mirrors and similar
glittering bodies; no mist, no dull sky, nor countless
other things, which I refrain from mentioning to avoid
getting wearisome. It has the advantage that it offers
greater resistance to time, although enamels on copper
fused in fire have equal power of resistance. Thus
painting surpasses sculpture even in durability.</p>

<p>Were you to speak only of painting on panels, I should
be content to give the verdict against sculpture by saying:
Whilst painting is more beautiful, more imaginative,
and more resourceful, sculpture is more durable;
and this is all that can be said for it. It reveals with
little effort what it is. Painting seems a miraculous
thing, making things intangible appear tangible, presenting
flat objects in relief, and distant near at hand. Indeed,
painting is adorned with endless possibilities that
are not used by sculpture.</p>

<p>Painters fight and compete with nature.</p>

<h4><i>Of the Ten Offices of the Eye</i></h4>

<p>Painting extends over all the ten offices of the eye&mdash;namely,
darkness, light, body and colour, figure and
scenery, distance and nearness, movement and repose&mdash;all
of which offices will be woven through this little work
of mine. For I will remind the painter by what rule
and in what manner he shall use his art to imitate all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
these things, the work of nature and the ornament of
the world.</p>

<h4><i>Rule for Beginners in Painting</i></h4>

<p>We know clearly that sight is one of the swiftest
actions in existence, perceiving in one moment countless
forms. Nevertheless, it cannot comprehend more than
one thing at a time. Suppose, for instance, you, reader,
were to cast a single glance upon this entire written
page and were to decide at once that it is full of different
letters; but you will not be able to recognize in this
space of time either what letters they are or what they
purport to say. Therefore, you must take word by word,
verse by verse, in order to gain knowledge from these letters.
Again, if you want to reach the summit of a building,
you must submit to climbing step by step, else it
would be impossible for you to reach the top. And so I
say to you, whom nature inclines to this art, if you would
have a true knowledge of the form of things, begin with
their details, and don't pass on to the second before the
first is well fixed in your memory, else you will waste
your time.</p>

<p>Perspective is the rein and rudder of painting.</p>

<p>I say whatever is forced within a border is more
difficult than what is free. Shadows have in certain
degrees their borders, and he who ignores them cannot
obtain roundness, which roundness is the essence and soul
of painting. Drawing is free, since, if you see countless
faces, they will all be different&mdash;the one has a long, the
other a short nose. Thus the painter may take this
liberty, and where is liberty, is no rule.</p>

<h4><i>Precepts for Painting</i></h4>

<p>The painter should endeavour to be universal, because
he is lacking in dignity if he do one thing well and another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
thing badly, like so many who only study the well-proportionate
nude and not its variations, because a man
may be proportionate and yet be short and stout, or long
and thin. And he who does not bear in mind these
variations will get his figures stereotyped, so that they
all seem to be brothers and sisters, which deserves to be
censured severely.</p>

<p>Let the sketching of histories be swift and the articulation
not too perfect. Be satisfied with suggesting the
position of the limbs, which you may afterwards carry
to completion at your leisure and as you please.</p>

<p>Methinks it is no small grace in a painter if he give
a pleasing air to his figures, a grace which, if it be not
one's own by nature, may be acquired by study, as follows.
Try to take the best parts from many beautiful
faces, whose beauty is affirmed by public fame rather
than by your own judgment, for you may deceive yourself
by taking faces which resemble your own. For it
would often seem that such similarities please us; and
if you were ugly you would not select beautiful faces,
and you would make ugly ones, like many painters whose
types often resemble their master. Therefore, take
beautiful features, as I tell you, and commit them to your
memory.</p>

<p>Monstrous is he who has a very large head and short
legs, and monstrous he who with rich garments has great
poverty; therefore we shall call him well proportioned
whose every part corresponds with his whole.</p>

<h4><i>On the Choice of Light</i></h4>

<p>If you had a courtyard, which you could cover at will
with a canvas awning, this light would be good; or when
you wish to paint somebody, paint him in bad weather,
or at the hour of dusk, placing the sitter with his back
to one of the walls of this courtyard.</p>

<p>Observe in the streets at the fall of the evening the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
faces of men and women when it is bad weather, what
grace and sweetness then appear to be theirs.</p>

<p>Therefore, you should have a courtyard, prepared
with walls painted in black, and with the roof projecting
a little over the said wall. And it should be ten <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">braccia</i>
[ten fathoms] in width, and twenty in length and ten in
height; and when the sun shines you should cover it
over with the awning, or you should paint an hour before
evening, when it is cloudy or misty. For this is the most
perfect light.</p>

<h4><i>Of the Gesture of Figures</i></h4>

<p>You should give your figures such movement as will
suffice to show what is passing in the mind of the figure;
else your art would not be praiseworthy. A figure is
not worthy of praise if it do not express by some gesture
the passion of the soul. That figure is most worthy of
praise which best expresses by its gesture the passion of
its nature.</p>

<p>If you have to represent an honest man talking, see
that his action be companion to his good words; and
again, if you have to depict a bestial man, give him wild
movements&mdash;his arms thrown towards the spectator, and
his head pressed towards his chest, his legs apart.</p>

<h4><i>The Judgment of Painting</i></h4>

<p>We know well that mistakes are more easily detected
in the works of others than in one's own, and often,
while censuring the small faults of others, you do not
recognise your own great faults. In order to escape
such ignorance, have a care that you be, above all,
sure of your perspective; then acquire full knowledge
of the proportions of man and other animals. And,
moreover, be a good architect; that is, in so far as it
is necessary for the form of the buildings and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
things that are upon the earth, and that are infinitely
varied in form.</p>

<p>The more knowledge you have of these, the more
worthy of praise will be your work. And for those
things in which you have no practice, do not disdain to
copy from nature. When you are painting, you should
take a flat mirror and often look at your work within
it. It will be seen in reverse, and will appear to be by
some other master, and you will be better able to judge
of its faults than in any other way. It is also a good
plan every now and then to go away and have a little
relaxation, for then, when you come back to the work,
your judgment will be surer, since to remain constantly
at work will cause you to lose the power of judgment.</p>

<p>Surely, while one paints one should not reject any
man's judgment; for we know very well that a man,
even if he be no painter, has knowledge of the forms of
another man, and will judge aright whether he is hump-backed,
or has one shoulder too high or too low, or
whether he has too large a mouth or nose, or other
faults; and if we are able rightly to judge the work of
nature in men, how much more is it fit to admit that they
are able to judge our mistakes.</p>

<p>You know how much man may be deceived about his
own works, and if you do not know it of yourself, observe
it in others, and you will derive benefit from other
people's mistakes. Therefore, you should be eager to
listen patiently to the views of other men and consider
and reflect carefully whether he who finds fault is right
or not in blaming you. If you find that he is right, correct
your work; but if not, pretend not to have understood
him; or show him, if he be a man whom you respect,
by sound argument, why it is that he is mistaken
in finding fault.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Do Not Disdain to Work from Nature</i></h4>

<p>A master who let it be understood that his mind could
retain all the forms and effects of nature, I should certainly
hold to be endowed with great ignorance, since
the said effects are infinite, and our memory is not of
such capacity as to suffice thereto. Therefore, O painter,
see that the greed for gain do not outweigh within you
the honour of art, for to gain in honour is a far greater
thing than to be honoured for wealth.</p>

<p>For these and other reasons that might be adduced,
you should endeavour first to demonstrate to the eye,
by means of drawing, a suggestion of the intention and
of the invention originated first by your imagination.
Then proceed, taking from it or adding to it, until you
are satisfied with it. Then have men arranged as models,
draped or nude, in the manner in which they are disposed
in your work, and make the proportions and size
in accordance with perspective, so that no part of the
work remains that is not counselled by reason as well
as by nature.</p>

<p>And this will be the way to make you honoured
through your art. First of all, copy drawings by a
good master made by his art from nature, and not as
exercises; then from a relief, keeping by you a drawing
done from the same relief; then from a good model, and
of this you ought to make a general practice.</p>

<h4><i>Of the Painter's Life in His Study</i></h4>

<p>The painter or draughtsman should be solitary, so that
physical comfort may not injure the thriving of the
mind, especially when he is occupied with the observations
and considerations which ever offer themselves to
his eye and provide material to be treasured up by the
memory. If you are alone, you belong wholly to yourself;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
and if you are accompanied even by one companion,
you belong only half to yourself; and if you are
with several of them, you will be even more subject to
such inconveniences.</p>

<p>And if you should say, "I shall take my own course,
I shall keep apart, so that I may be the better able to
contemplate the forms of natural objects," then I reply,
this cannot well be, because you cannot help frequently
lending your ear to their gossip; and since nobody can
serve two masters at once, you will badly fulfil your
duties as companion, and you will have worse success in
artistic contemplation. And if you should say, "I shall
keep so far apart that their words cannot reach me or
disturb me," then I reply in this case that you will be
looked upon as mad. And do you not perceive that,
in acting thus, you would really be solitary?</p>

<h4><i>Of Ways to Represent Various Scenes</i></h4>

<p>A man in despair you should make turning his knife
against himself. He should have rent his garments, and
he should be in the act of tearing open his wound with
one hand. And you should make him with his feet apart
and his legs somewhat bent, and the whole figure likewise
bending to the ground, with dishevelled and untidy hair.</p>

<p>As a rule, he whom you wish to represent talking to
many people will consider the subject of which he has
to treat, and will fit his gestures to this subject&mdash;that is
to say, if the subject is persuasion, the gestures should
serve this intention; if the subject is explanation by
various reasons, he who speaks should take a finger of
his left hand between two fingers of his right, keeping
the two smaller ones pressed together; his face should
be animated and turned towards the people, his mouth
slightly opened, so that he seems to be talking. And
if he is seated, let him seem to be in the act of slightly
raising himself, with his head forward; and if he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
standing, make him lean forward a little, with his head
towards the people, whom you should represent silent and
attentive, all watching, with gestures of admiration, the
orator's face. Some old men should have their mouths
drawn down at the corners in astonishment at what they
hear, drawing back the cheeks in many furrows, and
raising their eyebrows where they meet, so as to produce
many wrinkles on their foreheads. Some who are seated
should hold their tired knees between the interlaced
fingers of their hands, and others should cross one knee
over the other, and place upon it one hand, so that its
hollow supports the other elbow, whose hand again supports
the bearded chin.</p>

<p>Whatever is wholly deprived of light is complete darkness.
Night being in this condition, if you wish to represent
a scene therein, you must contrive to have a great
fire in this night, and everything that is in closer proximity
to this fire will assume more of its colour, because
the nearer a thing is to another object, the more it partakes
of its nature. And since you will make the fire
incline towards a red colour, you will have to give a reddish
tinge to all things lighted by it, and those which are
farther away from the fire will have to hold more of the
black colour of night. The figures which are between
you and the fire appear dark against the brightness of
the flame, for that part of the object which you perceive
is coloured by the darkness of night, and not by the brightness
of the fire; and those which flank the fire will be
half dark and half reddish. Those which are behind
the flames will be altogether illuminated by a reddish
light against the black background.</p>

<p>If you wish to represent a tempest properly, observe
and set down the effects of the wind blowing over the face
of the sea and of the land, raising and carrying away
everything that is not firmly rooted in the general mass.
And in order properly to represent this tempest, you
should first of all show the riven and torn clouds swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
along by the wind, together with the sandy dust blown
up from the seashore, and with branches and leaves
caught up and scattered through the air, together with
many other light objects, by the power of the furious
wind. The trees and shrubs, bent to the ground, seem to
desire to follow the direction of the wind, with branches
twisted out of their natural growth, and their foliage
tossed and inverted.</p>

<p>Of the men who are present, some who are thrown
down and entangled with their garments and covered
with dust should be almost unrecognisable; and those
who are left standing may be behind some tree which
they embrace, so that the storm should not carry them
off. Others, bent down, their garments and hair streaming
in the wind, should hold their hands before their
eyes because of the dust.</p>

<p>Let the turbulent and tempestuous sea be covered with
eddying foam between the rising waves, and let the wind
carry fine spray into the stormy air to resemble a thick
and all-enveloping mist. Of the ships that are there,
show some with rent sails, whose shreds should flap in
the air, together with some broken halyards; masts
splintered, tumbled, with the ship itself broken by the
fury of the waves; some human beings, shrieking, and
clinging to the wreckage of the vessel. You should show
the clouds, chased by the impetuous wind, hurled against
the high tops of the mountains, wreathing and eddying
like waves that beat against the cliffs. The air should
strike terror through the murky darkness caused by the
dust, the mist, and the heavy clouds.</p>

<h4><i>To Learn to Work from Memory</i></h4>

<p>If you want properly to commit to your memory something
that you have learnt, proceed in this manner&mdash;namely,
when you have drawn one object so often that
you believe you can remember it, try to draw it without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
the model, after having traced your model on a thin sheet
of glass. This glass you will then lay upon the drawing
which you have made without model. Observe well
where the tracing does not tally with your drawing, and
wherever you find that you have gone wrong, you must
remember not to go wrong again. You should even
return to the model, in order again to draw the wrong
passage until it shall be fixed in your memory. And if
you have no level sheet of glass for tracing, take a very
thin sheet of goat-parchment, well oiled, and then dried.
And after the tracing has done service for your drawing,
you can efface it with a sponge and use it again for
another tracing.</p>

<h4><i>On Studying in Bed</i></h4>

<p>I have experienced upon myself that it is of no small
benefit if, when you are in bed, you apply your imagination
to repeating the superficial lines of the forms which
you have been studying, or to other remarkable things
which are comprehensible to a fine intellect. This is a
praiseworthy and useful action which will help you to
fix things in your memory.</p>

<h3>Laocoon</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>In 1766, while acting as secretary to the governor of Breslau,
Lessing wrote his celebrated "Laocoon," a critical treatise defining
the limits of poetry and the plastic arts. The epitome
given here has been prepared from the German text. A short
biographical sketch of Lessing appears in the introduction to
his play, "Nathan the Wise," appearing in Volume XVII of <span class="smcap">The
World's Greatest Books</span>.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;On the Limits of Painting and Poetry</i></h4>

<p>Winkelman has pronounced a noble simplicity and
quiet grandeur, displayed in the posture no less than in
the expression, to be the characteristic feature common to
all the Greek masterpieces of painting and sculpture.
"As," says he, "the depths of the sea always remain
calm, however violently the surface may rage, so the expression
in the figures of the Greeks, under every form
of passion, shows a great and self-collected soul.</p>

<p>"This spirit is portrayed in the countenance of Laocoon,
but not in the countenance alone. Even under
the most violent suffering the pain discovers itself in
every muscle and sinew of his body, and the beholder,
while looking at the agonised conditions of the stomach,
without viewing the face and other parts, believes that
he almost feels the pain himself. The pain expresses
itself without any violence, both in the features and in
the whole posture. Laocoon suffers, but he suffers as
the Philoctetes of Sophocles. His misery pierces us to
the very soul, but inspires us with a wish that we could
endure misery like that great man.</p>

<p>"The expressing of so great a soul is far higher than
the painting of beautiful nature. The artist must feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
within himself that strength of spirit which he would
imprint on his marble. Greece had philosophers and
artists in one person. Philosophy gave her hand to art,
and inspired its figures with no ordinary souls."</p>

<p>The above remarks are founded on the argument that
"the pain in the face of Laocoon does not show itself
with that force which its intensity would have led us to
expect." This is correct. But I confess I differ from
Winkelman as to what, in his opinion, is the basis of this
wisdom, and as to the universality of the rule which he
deduces from it. I acknowledge I was startled, first by
the glances of disapproval which he casts on Virgil, and,
secondly, by the comparison with Philoctetes. From
this point I shall begin, writing down my thoughts as
they were developed in me.</p>

<p>"Laocoon suffers as does the Philoctetes of
Sophocles." But how does this last suffer? It is curious
that his sufferings should leave such a different impression
behind them. The cries and mild imprecations
with which he filled the camp and interrupted the sacrifices
echoed through the desolate island. The same
sounds of despair fill the theatre in the poet's imitation.</p>

<p>A cry is the natural expression of bodily pain.
Homer's wounded heroes frequently fall to the ground
with cries. They are in their actions beings of higher
order; in their feelings, true men.</p>

<p>We more civilised and refined Europeans of a wiser
and later age are forbidden to cry and weep, and even
our ancestors were taught to suppress lamentation at
loss, and to die laughing under the bites of adders. Not
so the Greeks. They felt and feared, and gave utterance
to pain and sorrow, only nothing must hold them
back from duty.</p>

<p>Now for my inference. If it be true that, a cry at the
sensation of bodily pain, according to the old Greek
way of thinking, is quite compatible with greatness of
soul, it cannot have been for the sake of expressing such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
greatness that the artist avoided imitating his shriek in
marble. Another reason must be found for his deviation
from his rival, the poet, who has expressed it with
the happiest results.</p>

<p>Be it fable or history, it is love that made the first
essay in the plastic arts, and never wearied of guiding
the hands of the masters of old. Painting now may be
defined generally as "the imitation of bodies of matter on
a level surface"; but the wise Greek allotted for it narrower
limits, and confined it to imitations of the beautiful
only; his artists painted nothing else. It was the perfection
of their work that absorbed them. Among the ancients
beauty was the highest law of the plastic arts. To
beauty everything was subordinated. There are passions
by which all beautiful physical lines are lost
through the distortion of the body, but from all such
emotions the ancient masters abstained entirely. Rage
and despair disgrace none of their productions, and I
dare maintain that they never painted a fury.</p>

<p>Indignation was softened down to seriousness. Grief
was lessened into mournfulness. All know how Timanthes
in his painting of the sacrifice of Iphigenia shows
the sorrow of the bystanders, but has concealed the face
of the father, who should show it more than all. He
left to conjecture what he might not paint. This concealment
is a sacrifice to beauty by the artist, and it
shows how art's first law is the law of beauty.</p>

<p>Now apply this to Laocoon. The master aimed at the
highest beauty compatible with the adopted circumstances
of bodily pain. He must soften shrieks into sighs. For
only imagine the mouth of Laocoon to be forced open,
and then judge.</p>

<p>But art in modern times has been allowed a far wider
sphere. It has been affirmed that its limitations extend
over the whole of visible nature, of which the beautiful
is but a small part. And as nature is ever ready to
sacrifice beauty to higher aims, so should the artist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
render it subordinate to his general design. But are
there not other considerations which compel the artist
to put certain limits to expression, and prevent him
from ever drawing it at its highest intensity?</p>

<p>I believe that the fact that it is to a single moment that
the material limits of art confine all its limitations, will
lead us to similar views.</p>

<p>If the artist out of ever-varying nature can only make
use of a single moment, while his works are meant to
stand the test not only of a passing glance, but of a long
and repeated contemplation, it is clear that this moment
cannot be chosen too happily. Now that only is a happy
choice which allows the imagination free scope. In
the whole course of a feeling there is no moment which
possesses this advantage so little as its highest stage.
There is nothing beyond this, and the presentation of extremes
to the eye clips the wings of fancy, prevents her
from soaring beyond the impression of the senses, and
compels her to occupy herself with weaker images. Thus
if Laocoon sighs, the imagination can hear him shriek;
but if he shrieks, it can neither rise above nor descend
below this representation without seeing him in a condition
which, as it will be more endurable, becomes less
interesting. It either hears him merely moaning, or
sees him already dead.</p>

<p>Of the frenzied Ajax of Timomachus we can form
some judgment from the account of Philoctetes. Ajax
does not appear raging among herds and slaughtering
cattle instead of men; but the master exhibits him sitting
wearied with these deeds of insanity, and that is really
the raging Ajax. We can form the most lively idea of
the extremity of his frenzy from the shame and despair
which he himself feels at the thought of it. We see
the storm in the wrecks and corpses which it had strewn
on the beach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;The Poet</i></h4>

<p>Perhaps hardly any of the above remarks concerning
the necessary limits of the artist would be found equally
applicable to poetry. It is undeniable that the whole
realm of the perfectly excellent lies open to the imitation
of the poet, that excellence of outward form which we
call beauty being only one of the least of the means
by which he can interest us in his characters.</p>

<p>Moreover, the poet is not compelled to concentrate his
picture into a single moment. He can take up every
action of his hero at its source, and pursue it to its issue
through all possible variations. Each of these, which
would cost the artist a separate work, costs the poet but
a single trait. What wonderful skill has Sophocles
shown in strengthening and enlarging, in his tragedy of
Philoctetes, the idea of bodily pain! He chose a wound,
and not an internal malady, because the former admits
of a more lively representation than the latter. This
wound was, moreover, a punishment divinely decreed.
But to the Greeks a wound from a poisoned arrow was
but an ordinary incident. Why, then, in the case of
Philoctetes only was it followed by such dreadful consequences?</p>

<p>Sophocles felt full well that, however great he made
the bodily pain to his hero, it would not have sufficed of
itself to excite any remarkable degree of sympathy. He
therefore combined it with other evils&mdash;the complete
lack of society, hunger, and all the hardships to which
such a man under terrible privations is exposed when
cast on a wild, deserted isle of the Cyclades.</p>

<p>Imagine, now, a man in these conditions, but give him
health and strength and industry, and he becomes a
Crusoe, whose lot, though not indifferent to us, has no
great claim on our sympathy. On the other hand, imagine
a man afflicted by a painful and incurable disease,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
but at the same time surrounded by kind friends. For
him we should feel sympathy, yet this would not endure
throughout. Only when both cases are combined do we
see nothing but despair, which excites our amazement
and horror. Typical beauty arises from the harmonious
effect of numerous parts, all of which the sight is capable
of comprehending at the same time. It requires, therefore,
that these parts should lie near each other; and
since things whose parts lie near each other are the
peculiar objects of plastic beauty, these it is, and these
only, which can imitate typical beauty. The poet, since
he can only exhibit in succession its component parts,
entirely abstains from the description of typical beauty.
He feels that these parts, ranged one after the other,
cannot possibly have the effect they produce when closely
arranged together.</p>

<p>In this respect Homer is a pattern of patterns. He
says Nireus was beautiful, Achilles still more so, Helen
was endowed with divine beauty. But nowhere does
he enter on a detailed sketch of these beauties, and yet
the whole Iliad is based on the loveliness of Helen.</p>

<p>In this point, in which he can imitate Homer by merely
doing nothing, Virgil is also tolerably happy. His
heroine Dido, too, is never anything more than <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pulcherrima</i>
Dido (loveliest Dido). When he wishes to be more
circumstantial, he is so in the description of her rich dress
and apparel.</p>

<p>Lucian, also, was too acute to convey any idea of the
body of Panthea otherwise than by reference to the
most lovely female statues of the old artists.</p>

<p>Yet what is this but the acknowledgment that language
by itself is here without power; that poetry falters
and eloquence grows speechless unless art in some
measure serve them as an interpreter?</p>

<p>But, it will be said, does not poetry lose too much if we
deprive her of all objects of typical beauty? Who
would deprive her of them? Because we would debar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
her from wandering among the footsteps of her sister
art, without ever reaching the same goal as she, do we
exclude her from every other, where art in her turn must
gaze after her steps with fruitless longings?</p>

<p>Even Homer, who so pointedly abstains from all
detailed descriptions of typical beauties, from whom we
but just learn that Helen had white arms and lovely
hair, even he, with all this, knew how to convey to us
an idea of her beauty which far exceeds anything that
art is able to accomplish.</p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;Beauty and Charm</i></h4>

<p>Again, another means which poetry possesses of rivalling
art in the description of typical beauty is the change
of beauty into charm. Charm is beauty in motion, and is
for this very reason less suitable to the painter than to
the poet. The painter can only leave motion to conjecture,
while in fact his figures are motionless. Consequently,
with him charm becomes grimace.</p>

<p>But in poetry it remains what it is, a transitory beauty
which we would gladly see repeated. It comes and goes,
and since we can generally recall to our minds a movement
more easily and vividly than forms or colours,
charm necessarily in the same circumstances produces a
stronger effect than beauty.</p>

<p>Zeuxis painted a Helen, and had the courage to write
below the picture those renowned lines of Homer in
which the enraptured elders confess their sensations.
Never had painting and poetry been engaged in such
contest. The contest remained undecided, and both deserved
the crown.</p>

<p>For just as a wise poet showed us the beauty which
he felt he could not paint according to its constituent
parts, but merely in its effect, so the no less wise painter
showed us that beauty by nothing but those parts, deeming
it unbecoming for his art to resort to any other means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
for aid. His picture consisted of a single figure, undraped,
of Helen, probably the one painted for the people
of Crotona.</p>

<p>In beauty a single unbecoming part may disturb the
harmonious effect of many, without the object necessarily
becoming ugly. For ugliness, too, requires several unbecoming
parts, all of which we must be able to comprehend
at the same view before we experience sensations
the opposite of those which beauty produces.</p>

<p>According to this, therefore, ugliness in its essence
could be no subject of poetry; yet Homer has painted
extreme ugliness in Thersites, and this ugliness is described
according to its parts near each other. Why in
the case of ugliness did he allow himself the license from
which he had abstained in that of beauty? A successive
enumeration of the elements of beauty will annihilate
its effects. Will not a similar cause produce a similar
effect in the case of ugliness?</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it will; but it is in this very fact that the
justification of Homer lies. The poet can only take
advantage of ugliness so far as it is reduced in his description
into the less repugnant appearance of bodily
imperfection, and ceases, as it were, in point of effect, to
be ugliness. Thus, what he cannot make use of by itself
he can use as the ingredient for the purpose of producing
and strengthening certain mixed sensations.</p>

<p>These mixed feelings are the ridiculous and the horrible.
Homer makes Thersites ugly in order to make
him ridiculous. He is not made so, however, merely by
his ugliness, for ugliness is an imperfection, and the contrast
of perfection with imperfections is required to
produce the ridiculous. To this I may add that the contrast
must not be too sharp and glaring, and that the
contrasts must blend into each other.</p>

<p>The wise and virtuous Ã†sop does not become ridiculous
because of ugliness attributed to him. For his
misshapen body and beautiful mind are as oil and vinegar;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
however much you shake them together, they always
remain distinct to the taste. They will not amalgamate
to produce a third quality. The body produces annoyance;
the soul, pleasure; each has its own effect.</p>

<p>It is only when the deformed body is also fragile and,
sickly, when it impedes the soul, that the annoyance and
pleasure melt into each other.</p>

<p>For, let us suppose that the instigations of the malicious
and snarling Thersites had resulted in mutiny, that the
people had forsaken their leaders and departed in the
ships, and that these leaders had been massacred by a
revengeful foe. How would the ugliness of Thersites
appear then? If ugliness, when harmless, may be ridiculous,
when hurtful it is always horrible. In Shakespeare's
"King Lear," Edmund, the bastard Count of
Gloucester, is no less a villain than Richard, Duke of
Gloucester, in "King Richard III." How is it, then, that
the first excites our loathing so much less than the second?
It is because when I hear the former, I listen to
a devil, but see him as an angel of light; but in listening
to Richard I hear a devil and see a devil.</p>

<h3>Essay on Liberty</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Ten years elapsed between the publication of "Political Economy"
(see Vol. XIV, p. 294) and the "Essay on Liberty," Mill
in the meantime (1851) having married Mrs. John Taylor, a lady
who exercised no small influence on his philosophical position.
The seven years of his married life saw little or nothing from
his pen. The "Essay on Liberty," in many respects the most
carefully prepared of all his books, appeared in 1859, the year
following the death of his wife, in collaboration with whom it
was thought out and partly written. The treatise goes naturally
with that on "Utilitarianism." Both are succinct and incisive in
their reasoning, and both are grounded on similar sociological
principles. Perhaps the primary problem of politics in all ages
has been the reconciliation of individual and social interests; and
at the present day, when the problem appears to be particularly
troublesome, Mill's view of the situation is of especial value.
In recent time, legislation has certainly tended to become more
socialistic, and the doctrine of individual liberty promulgated
in this "Essay" has a most interesting relevancy to modern
social movements.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;Liberty of Thought and Discussion</i></h4>

<p>Protection against popular government is as indispensable
as protection against political despotism. The
people may desire to oppress a part of their number, and
precautions are needed against this as against any other
abuse of power. So much will be readily granted by
most, and yet no attempt has been made to find the fitting
adjustment between individual independence and social
control.</p>

<p>The object of this essay is to assert the simple principle
that the sole end for which mankind are warranted,
individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty
of action of any of their number is self-protection&mdash;that
the only purpose for which power can be rightfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
exercised over any member of a civilised community,
against his will, is to prevent harm to others, either by
his action or inaction. The only part of the conduct of
anyone for which he is amenable to society is that which
concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself,
his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself,
over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.</p>

<p>This principle requires, firstly, liberty of conscience in
the most comprehensive sense, liberty of thought and
feeling; absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on
all subjects, practical or speculative, scientific, moral, or
theological&mdash;the liberty even of publishing and expressing
opinions. Secondly, the principle requires liberty of
tastes and pursuits; of framing the plan of our life to
suit our own character; of doing as we like, so long as we
do not harm our fellow-creatures. Thirdly, the principle
requires liberty of combination among individuals
for any purpose not involving harm to others, provided
the persons are of full age and not forced or deceived.</p>

<p>The only freedom which deserves the name is that
of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we
do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede
their efforts to obtain it. Mankind gains more by suffering
each other to live as seems good to themselves
than by compelling each to live as seems good to the
rest.</p>

<p>Coercion in matters of thought and discussion must
always be illegitimate. If all mankind save one were of
one opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing
the solitary individual than he, if he had the power,
would be justified in silencing mankind. The peculiar
evil of silencing the expression of opinion is that it is
robbing the whole human race, present and future&mdash;those
who dissent from the opinion even more than those who
hold it. For if the opinion is right, they are deprived
of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
if wrong, they lose the clear and livelier impression of
truth produced by its collision with error.</p>

<p>All silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility,
and, as all history teaches, neither communities
nor individuals are infallible. Men cannot be too often
reminded of the condemnation of Socrates and of Christ,
and of the persecution of the Christians by the noble-minded
Marcus Aurelius.</p>

<p>Enemies of religious freedom maintain that persecution
is a good thing, for, even though it makes mistakes,
it will root out error while it cannot extirpate truth. But
history shows that even if truth cannot be finally extirpated,
it may at least be put back centuries.</p>

<p>We no longer put heretics to death; but we punish
heresies with a social stigma almost as effective, since
it may debar men from earning their bread. Social intolerance
does not actually eradicate heresies, but it induces
men to hide unpopular opinions. The result is
that new and heretical opinions smoulder in the narrow
circles of thinking and studious persons who originate
them, and never light up the general affairs of mankind
with either a true or deceptive light. The price paid for
intellectual pacification is the sacrifice of the entire moral
courage of the human race. Who can compute what the
world loses in the multitude of promising intellects too
timid to follow out any bold, independent train of
thought lest it might be considered irreligious or immoral?
No one can be a great thinker who does not follow
his intellect to whatever conclusions it may lead. In
a general atmosphere of mental slavery a few great
thinkers may survive, but in such an atmosphere there
never has been, and never will be, an intellectually active
people; and all progress in the human mind and in human
institutions may be traced to periods of mental
emancipation.</p>

<p>Even if an opinion be indubitably true and undoubtingly
believed, it will be a dead dogma, and not a living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
truth, if it be not fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed.
If the cultivation of the understanding consists
of one thing more than another, it is surely in learning
the grounds of one's own opinions, and these can
only be fully learned by facing the arguments that favour
the opposite opinions. He who knows only his own
side of the case knows little of that. Unless he knows
the difficulties which his truth has to encounter and
conquer, he knows little of the force of his truth. Not
only are the grounds of an opinion unformed or forgotten
in the absence of discussion, but too often the very
meaning of the opinion. When the mind is not compelled
to exercise its powers on the questions which its
belief presents to it, there is a progressive tendency to
forget all of the belief except the formularies, until it
almost ceases to connect itself at all with the inner life
of the human being. In such cases a creed merely stands
sentinel at the entrance of the mind and heart to keep
them empty, as is so often seen in the case of the Christian
creed as at present professed.</p>

<p>So far we have considered only two possibilities&mdash;that
the received opinion may be false and some other opinion
consequently true, or that, the received opinion being
true, a conflict with the opposite error is essential to a
clear apprehension and deep feeling of the truth. But
there is a commoner case still, when conflicting doctrines
share the truth, and when the heretical doctrine completes
the orthodox. Every opinion which embodies
somewhat of the portion of the truth which the common
opinion omits, ought to be considered precious with whatever
amount of error and confusion it may be conjoined.
In politics, again, it is almost a commonplace that a party
of order or stability, and a party of progress or reform,
are both necessary factors in a healthy political life.
Unless opinions favourable to democracy and to aristocracy,
to property, and to equality, to co-operation and to
competition, to sociality and to individuality, to liberty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
and to discipline, and all the other standing antagonisms
of practical life are expressed with equal freedom, and
enforced and defended with equal talent and energy,
there is no chance of both elements obtaining their due.
Truth is usually reached only by the rough process of
a struggle between combatants fighting under hostile
banners.</p>

<p>It may be objected, "But <em>some</em> received principles,
especially on the highest and most vital subjects, are
more than half-truths." This objection is not sound.
Even the Christian morality is, in many important points,
incomplete and one-sided, and unless ideas and feelings
not sanctioned by it had constituted to the formation of
European life and character, human affairs would have
been in a worse condition than they now are.</p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;Individuality as One of the Elements of Well-Being</i></h4>

<p>We have seen that opinions should be freely formed
and freely expressed. How about <em>actions</em>? If a man
refrains from molesting others in what concerns him,
and merely acts according to his own inclination and
judgment in things which concern himself, the same reasons
which show that opinion should be free prove also
that he should be allowed to carry his opinions into
action. As it is useful that while mankind are imperfect
there should be different opinions, so it is useful
that there should be different experiments of living, that
free scope should be given to varieties of character short
of injury to others, and that the worth of different
modes of life should be proved practically. It is desirable,
in short, that in things which do not primarily concern
others, individuality should assert itself. When,
not the person's own character, but the traditions or customs
of other people are the rule of conduct, there is
wanting one of the principal ingredients of human happiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
and quite the chief ingredient of individual and
social progress.</p>

<p>No one's idea of excellence in conduct is that people
should do absolutely nothing but copy one another. On
the other hand, it would be absurd to pretend that people
ought to live as if experience had as yet done nothing
towards showing that one mode of existence or of conduct
is preferable to another. No one denies that people
should be so taught and trained in youth as to know and
benefit by the results of human experience. But it is the
privilege of a mature man to use and interpret experience
in his own way. He who lets the world, or his own
portion of it, choose his plan of life for him has no
need of any other faculty than the ape-like one of imitation.
He, on the other hand, who chooses his plan for
himself, employs all his faculties&mdash;reasoning, foresight,
activity, discrimination, resolution, self-control. We
wish not automatons, but living, originating men and
women.</p>

<p>So much will be readily conceded, but nevertheless it
may be maintained that strong desires and passions are
a peril and a snare. Yet it is desires and impulses which
constitute character, and one with no desires and impulses
of his own has no more character than a steam-engine.
An energetic character implies strong, spontaneous
impulses under the control of a strong will; and
such characters are desirable, since the danger which
threatens modern society is not excess but deficiency of
personal impulses and preferences. Everyone nowadays
asks: what is usually done by persons of my station and
pecuniary circumstances, or (worse still) what is usually
done by persons of a station and circumstances superior
to mine? The consequence is that, through failure
to follow their own nature, they have no nature to follow;
their human capacities are withered and starved,
and are incapable of any strong pleasures or opinions
properly their own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
It is not by pruning away the individual but by cultivating
it wisely that human beings become valuable to
themselves and to others, and that human life becomes
rich, diversified, and interesting. Individuality is equivalent
to development, and in proportion to the latitude
given to individuality an age becomes noteworthy or the
reverse.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the general tendency of things is to
render mediocrity the ascendant power. At present, individuals
are lost in the crowd, and it is almost a triviality
to say that public opinion now rules the world. And
public opinion is the opinion of collective mediocrity, and
is expressed by mediocre men. The initiation of all wise
and noble opinions must come from individuals, and the
individuality of those who stand on the higher eminences
of thought is necessary to correct the tendency that
makes mankind acquiesce in customary and popular
opinions.</p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;The Limits of the Authority of Society Over the
Individual</i></h4>

<p>Where, then, does the authority of society begin? How
much of human life should be assigned to individuality,
and how much to society?</p>

<p>To individuality should belong that part of life in
which it is chiefly the individual that is interested; to
society, the part which chiefly interests society.</p>

<p>Society, in return for the protection it affords its
members, and as a condition of its existence, demands,
firstly, that its members respect the rights of one another;
and, secondly, that each person bear his share
of the labours and sacrifices incurred in defending society
for its members. Further, society may punish acts
of an individual hurtful to others, even if not a violation
of rights, by the force of public opinion.</p>

<p>But in all cases where a person's conduct affects or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
need only affect himself, society may not interfere. Society
may help individuals in their personal affairs, but
neither one person, nor any number of persons, is warranted
in saying to any human creature that he may
not use his own life, so far as it concerns himself, as he
pleases. He himself is the final judge of his own concerns,
and the inconveniences which are strictly inseparable
from the unfavourable judgment of others are
the only ones to which a person should ever be subjected
for that portion of his conduct and character which affects
his own good, but which does not affect the interests
of others.</p>

<p>But how, it may be asked, can any part of the conduct
of a member of society be a matter of indifference
to the other members?</p>

<p>I fully confess that the mischief which a person does
to himself may seriously affect those nearly connected
with him, and even society at large. But such contingent
and indirect injury should be endured by society
for the sake of the greater good of human freedom, and
because any attempt at coercion in private conduct will
merely produce rebellion on the part of the individual
coerced. Moreover, when society interferes with purely
personal conduct, the odds are that it interferes wrongly,
and in the wrong places, as the pages of history and the
records of legislation abundantly demonstrate.</p>

<p>Closely connected with the question of the limitations
of the authority of society over the individual is the
question of government participation in industrial and
other enterprises generally undertaken by individuals.</p>

<p>There are three main objections to the interference of
the state in such matters. In the first place, the matter
may be better managed by individuals than by the government.
In the second place, though individuals may
not do it so well as government might, yet it is desirable
that they should do it, as a means of their own mental
education. In the third place, it is undesirable to add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
to the power of the government. If roads, railways,
banks, insurance offices, great joint-stock companies,
universities, public charities, municipal corporations, and
local boards were all in the government service, and if
the employees in these look to the government for promotion,
not all the freedom of the Press and the popular constitution
of the legislature would make this or any other
country free otherwise than in name. And, for various
reasons, the better qualified the heads and hands of the
government officials, the more detrimental would the rule
of the government be. Such a government would inevitably
degenerate into a pedantocracy monopolising all the
occupations which form and cultivate the faculties required
for the government of mankind.</p>

<p>To find the best compromise between individuals and
the state is difficult, but I believe the ideal must combine
the greatest possible dissemination of power consistent
with efficiency, and the greatest possible centralisation
and diffusion of information.</p>

<h2 id="ch_257"><a name="JOHN_MILTON" id="JOHN_MILTON">JOHN MILTON</a></h2>

<h3>Areopagitica</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>It has been said of "Areopagitica, a Speech of Mr. John Milton
for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing to the Parliament
of England," that it is "the piece that lies more surely than any
other at the very heart of our prose literature." In 1637 the Star
Chamber issued a decree regulating the printing, circulation, and
importation of books, and on June 14, 1643, the Long Parliament
published an order in the same spirit. Milton (see Vol. XVII)
felt that what had been done in the days of repression and tyranny
was being continued under the reign of liberty, and that the time
for protest had arrived. Liberty was the central principle of
Milton's faith. He regarded it as the most potent, beneficent,
and sacred factor in human progress; and he applied it all
round&mdash;to literature, religion, marriage, and civic life. His
"Areopagitica," published in November, 1644, was an application
of the principle to literature that has remained unanswered.
The word "Areopagitica" is derived from Areopagus, the celebrated
open-air court in Athens, whose decision in matters of
public importance was regarded as final.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;The Right of Appeal</i></h4>

<p>It is not a liberty which we can hope, that no grievance
ever should arise in the Commonwealth&mdash;that let no man
in this world expect; but when complaints are freely
heard, deeply considered, and speedily reformed, then is
the utmost bound of civil liberty attained that wise men
look for. To which we are already in good part arrived;
and this will be attributed first to the strong assistance of
God our Deliverer, next to your faithful guidance and
undaunted wisdom, Lords and Commons of England.</p>

<p>If I should thus far presume upon the meek demeanour
of your civil and gentle greatness, Lords and Commons,
as to gainsay what your published Order hath directly
said, I might defend myself with ease out of those ages
to whose polite wisdom and letters we owe that we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
not yet Goths and Jutlanders. Such honour was done in
those days to men who professed the study of wisdom
and eloquence that cities and signiories heard them gladly,
and with great respect, if they had aught in public to
admonish the state.</p>

<p>When your prudent spirit acknowledges and obeys the
voice of reason from what quarter soever it be heard
speaking, I know not what should withhold me from
presenting ye with a fit instance wherein to show, both
that love of truth which ye eminently profess, and that
uprightness of your judgment which is not wont to be
partial to yourselves, by judging over again that Order
which ye have ordained to regulate printing: that no
book, pamphlet, or paper shall be henceforth printed unless
the same be first approved and licensed by such, or at
least one of such, as shall be thereto appointed.</p>

<p>I shall lay before ye, first, that the inventors of licensing
books be those whom ye will be loth to own; next, what
is to be thought in general of reading, whatever sort the
books be; last, that it will be primely to the discouragement
of all learning and the stop of truth. I deny not
that it is of greatest concernment in the Church and
commonwealth to have a vigilant eye how books demean
themselves, as well as men. For books are not
absolutely dead things, but do contain a potency of life
in them to be as active as that soul was whose progeny
they are.</p>

<p>Nay, they do preserve as in a vial the purest efficacy
and extraction of that living intellect that bred them. I
know they are as lively and as vigorously productive as
those fabulous dragon's teeth; and, being sown up and
down, may chance to spring up armed men. And yet,
on the other hand, unless wariness be used, as good almost
kill a man as kill a good book. Many a man lives
a burden to the earth; but a good book is the precious
life-blood of a master spirit, embalmed and treasured up
on purpose to life beyond life. 'Tis true, no age can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
restore a life, whereof perhaps there is no great loss;
and revolutions of ages do not oft recover the loss of a
rejected truth, for the want of which whole nations fare
the worse.</p>

<p>We should be wary, therefore, how we spill that
seasoned life of man, preserved and stored up in books,
since we see a kind of homicide may be thus committed,
that strikes at that ethereal essence, the breath of reason
itself, and slays an immortality rather than a life.</p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;The History of Repression</i></h4>

<p>In Athens, where books and wits were ever busier than
in any other part of Greece, I find but only two sorts of
writings which the magistrate cared to take notice of&mdash;those
either blasphemous and atheistical, or libellous.
The Romans, for many ages trained up only to a military
roughness, knew of learning little. There libellous
authors were quickly cast into prison, and the like severity
was used if aught were impiously written. Except in
these two points, how the world went in books the
magistrate kept no reckoning.</p>

<p>By the time the emperors were become Christians, the
books of those whom they took to be grand heretics were
examined, refuted, and condemned in the general councils,
and not till then were prohibited.</p>

<p>As for the writings of heathen authors, unless they
were plain invectives against Christianity, they met with
no interdict that can be cited till about the year 400. The
primitive councils and bishops were wont only to declare
what books were not commendable, passing no further
till after the year 800, after which time the popes of
Rome extended their dominion over men's eyes, as they
had before over their judgments, burning and prohibiting
to be read what they fancied not, till Martin V. by
his Bull not only prohibited, but was the first that excommunicated
the reading of heretical books; for about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
that time Wickliffe and Huss, growing terrible, drove
the papal court to a stricter policy of prohibiting. To
fill up the measure of encroachment, their last invention
was to ordain that no book, pamphlet, or paper should
be printed (as if St. Peter had bequeathed them the
keys of the press also out of Paradise), unless it were
approved and licensed under the hands of two or three
glutton friars.</p>

<p>Not from any ancient state or polity or church, nor by
any statute left us by our ancestors, but from the most
tyrannous Inquisition have ye this book-licensing. Till
then books were as freely admitted into the world as
any other birth. No envious Juno sat cross-legged over
the nativity of any man's intellectual offspring. That ye
like not now these most certain authors of this licensing
Order, all men who know the integrity of your actions
will clear ye readily.</p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;The Futility of Prohibition</i></h4>

<p>But some will say, "What though the inventors were
bad, the thing, for all that, may be good?" It may be
so, yet I am of those who believe it will be a harder
alchemy than Lullius ever knew to sublimate any good
use out of such an invention.</p>

<p>Good and evil in the field of this world grow up together
almost inseparably. As the state of man now is,
what wisdom can there be to choose, what continence to
forbear, without the knowledge of evil? I cannot praise
a fugitive and cloistered virtue, unexercised and unbreathed,
that never sallies out and sees her adversary,
but slinks out of the race, where that immortal garland
is to be run for, not without dust and heat. That which
purifies us is trial, and trial is by what is contrary. And
how can we more safely, and with less danger scout into
the regions of sin and falsity than by reading all manner
of tractates and hearing all manner of reason? And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
this is the benefit which may be had of books promiscuously
read.</p>

<p>'Tis next alleged we must not expose ourselves to
temptations without necessity, and next to that, not employ
our time in vain things. To both these objections
one answer will serve&mdash;that to all men such books are not
temptations, nor vanities, but useful drugs and materials
wherewith to temper and compose effective and strong
medicines. The rest, as children and childish men, who
have not the art to qualify and prepare these working
minerals, well may be exhorted to forbear, but hindered
forcibly they cannot be by all the licensing that sainted
Inquisition could ever yet contrive.</p>

<p>This Order of licensing conduces nothing to the end
for which it was framed. If we think to regulate printing,
thereby to rectify manners, we must regulate all recreations
and pastimes, all that is delightful to man. No
music must be heard, no song be set or sung, but what is
grave and Doric. There must be licensing dancers, that
no gesture, motion, or deportment be taught our youth
but what by their allowance shall be thought honest.
Our garments, also, should be referred to the licensing
of some more sober workmasters to see them cut into a
less wanton garb. Who shall regulate all the mixed
conversation of our youth? Who shall still appoint what
shall be discoursed, what presumed, and no further?
Lastly, who shall forbid and separate all idle resort, all
evil company? If every action which is good or evil in
man at ripe years were to be under pittance and prescription
and compulsion, what were virtue but a name?</p>

<p>When God gave Adam reason, he gave him reason to
choose, for reason is but choosing. Wherefore did he
create passions within us, pleasures round about us, but
that these rightly tempered are the very ingredients of
virtue?</p>

<p>Why should we then affect a rigour contrary to the
manner of God and of nature, by abridging or scanting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
those means which books freely permitted are both to the
trial of virtue and the exercise of truth?</p>

<h4><i>IV.&mdash;An Indignity to Learning</i></h4>

<p>I lastly proceed from the no good it can do to the
manifest hurt it causes in being, first, the greatest discouragement
and affront that can be offered to learning
and to learned men. If ye be loth to dishearten utterly
and discontent the free and ingenuous sort of such as were
born to study, and love learning for itself, not for lucre
or any other end but the service of God and of truth, and
perhaps that lasting fame and perpetuity of praise which
God and good men have consented shall be the reward of
those whose published labours advance the good of mankind,
then know that so far to distrust the judgment and
the honesty of one who hath but a common repute in
learning, and never yet offended, as not to count him fit
to print his mind without a tutor and examiner, is the
greatest displeasure and indignity to a free and knowing
spirit that can be put upon him.</p>

<p>When a man writes to the world he summons up all his
reason and deliberation to assist him; he searches, meditates,
is industrious, and likely consults and confers with
his judicious friends. If in this, the most consummate
act of his fidelity and ripeness, no years, no industry, no
former proof of his abilities can bring him to that state
of maturity as not to be still mistrusted and suspected,
unless he carry all his considerate diligence to the hasty
view of an unleisured licenser, perhaps much his younger,
perhaps far his inferior in judgment, perhaps one who
never knew the labour of book-writing, and if he be not
repulsed or slighted, must appear in print with his
censor's hand on the back of his title, to be his bail and
surety that he is no idiot or seducer, it cannot be but a
dishonour and derogation to the author, to the book, to
the privilege and dignity of learning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
And, further, to me it seems an undervaluing and
vilifying of the whole nation. I cannot set so light by
all the invention, the art, the wit, the grave and solid
judgment which is in England, as that it can be comprehended
in any twenty capacities how good soever, much
less that it should not pass except their superintendence
be over it, except it be sifted and strained with their
strainers, that it should be uncurrent without their manual
stamp. Truth and understanding are not such wares as
to be monopolised and traded in by tickets and statutes
and standards.</p>

<p>Lords and Commons of England, consider what nation
it is whereof ye are, and whereof ye are the governors&mdash;a
nation not slow and dull, but of a quick, ingenious and
piercing spirit, acute to invent, subtle and sinewy to discourse,
not beneath the reach of any point the highest
that human capacity can soar to. Is it for nothing that
the grave and frugal Transylvanian sends out yearly
from as far as the mountainous borders of Russia, and
beyond the Hercynian wilderness, not their youth, but
their staid men, to learn our language and our theologic
arts? By all concurrence of signs, and by the general
instinct of holy and devout men, God is decreeing to begin
some new and great period in His Church, even to the
reforming of Reformation itself. What does He, then,
but reveal Himself to His servants, and as His manner
is, first to His Englishmen?</p>

<p>Behold now this vast city&mdash;a city of refuge, the mansion
house of liberty, encompassed and surrounded with
His protection. The shop of war hath not there more
anvils and hammers waking to fashion out the plates and
instruments of armed justice in defence of beleaguered
truth than there be pens and heads there, sitting by their
studious lamps, musing, searching, revolving new notions
and ideas wherewith to present, as with their homage
and their fealty, the approaching Reformation; others
as fast reading, trying all things, assenting to the force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
of reason and convincement. What could a man require
more from a nation so pliant and so prone to seek after
knowledge? Where there is much desire to learn, there,
of necessity, will be much arguing, much writing, many
opinions; for opinion in good men is but knowledge in
the making. A little generous prudence, a little forbearance
of one another, and some grain of charity might win
all these diligencies to join and unite in one general search
after truth, could we but forego this prelatical tradition
of crowding free consciences and Christian liberties into
canons and precepts of men.</p>

<p>Methinks I see in my mind a noble and puissant nation
rousing herself like a strong man after sleep, and shaking
her invincible locks. Methinks I see her as an eagle
mewing her mighty youth, and kindling her undazzled
eyes at the full midday beam; purging and unsealing her
long-abused sight at the fountain itself of heavenly
radiance; while the whole noise of timorous and flocking
birds, with those also that love the twilight, flutter about,
amazed at what she means, and in their envious gabble
would prognosticate a year of sects and schisms.</p>

<p>What should ye do then? Should ye suppress all this
flowery crop of knowledge and new light? Should ye
set an oligarchy of twenty engrossers over it, to bring a
famine upon our minds again, when we shall know nothing
but what is measured to us by their bushel? Believe
it, Lords and Commons, they who counsel ye to
such a suppressing do as good as bid ye suppress yourselves.
If it be desired to know the immediate cause of
all this free writing and free speaking, there cannot be
assigned a truer than your own mild, and free, and
humane government. It is the liberty, Lords and Commons,
which our own valorous and happy counsels have
purchased us, liberty, which is the nurse of all great wits.
Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely
according to conscience above all liberties. And though
all the winds of doctrine were let loose to play upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
earth, so Truth be in the field, we do injuriously, by
licensing and prohibiting, to misdoubt her strength. Let
her and Falsehood grapple. Whoever knew Truth put
to the worse in a free and open encounter? For who
knows not that Truth is strong, next to the Almighty?
She needs no policies, nor stratagems, nor licensing to
make her victorious. Those are the shifts and defences
that error uses against her power. Give her but room,
and do not bind her when she sleeps.</p>

<h3>Parallel Lives</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Little is known of the life of Plutarch, greatest of biographers.
He was born about 50 <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>, at ChÃ¦ronea, in BÅ“otia,
Greece, the son of a learned and virtuous father. He studied
philosophy under Ammonius at Delphi, and on his return to his
native city became a priest of Apollo, and archon, or chief
magistrate. Plutarch wrote many philosophical works, which
are enumerated by his son Lamprias, but are no longer extant.
We have about fifty biographies, which are called "parallel"
because of the method by which Plutarch, after giving separately
the lives of two or more people, proceeds to compare them
with one another. The "Lives" were translated into French
in Henry II.'s reign, and into English in the time of Elizabeth.
They have been exceedingly popular at every period, and many
authors, including Shakespeare, have owed much to them. Plutarch
died about 120 <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span></p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;Lycurgus and Numa</i></h4>

<p>According to the best authors, Lycurgus, the law-giver,
reigned only for eight months as king of Sparta,
until the widow of the late king, his brother, had given
birth to a son, whom he named Charilaus. He then
travelled for some years in Crete, Asia, and possibly also
in Egypt, Libya, Spain, and India, studying governments
and manners; and returning to Sparta, he set himself to
alter the whole constitution of that kingdom, with the encouragement
of the oracles and the favour of Charilaus.</p>

<p>The first institution was a senate of twenty-eight members,
whose place it was to strengthen the throne when
the people encroached too far, and to support the people
when the king should attempt to become absolute. Occasional
popular assemblies, in the open air, were to be
called, not to propose any subject of debate, but only to
ratify or reject the proposals of the senate and the two
kings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
His second political enterprise was a new division of
the lands, for he found a prodigious inequality, wealth
being centred in the hands of a few; and by this reform
Laconia became like an estate newly divided among many
brothers. Each plot of land was sufficient to maintain a
family in health, and they wanted nothing more.</p>

<p>Then, desiring also to equalise property in movable
objects, he resorted to the device of doing away with gold
and silver currency, and establishing an iron coinage, of
which great bulk and weight went to but little value. He
excluded all unprofitable and superfluous arts; and the
Spartans soon had no means of purchasing foreign
wares, nor did any merchant ship unlade in their harbours.
Luxury died away of itself, and the workmanship
of their necessary and useful furniture rose to great
excellence.</p>

<p>Public tables were now established, where all must eat
in common of the same frugal meal; whereby hardiness
and health of body and mutual benevolence of mind were
alike promoted. There were about fifteen to a table, to
which each contributed in provisions or in money; the
conversation was liberal and well-informed, and salted
with pleasant raillery.</p>

<p>Lycurgus left no law in writing; he depended on principles
pervading the customs of the people; and he reduced
the whole business of legislation into the bringing
up of the young. And in this matter he began truly at
the beginning, by regulating marriages. The man unmarried
after the prescribed age was prosecuted and
disgraced; and the father of four children was immune
from taxation.</p>

<p>Lycurgus considered the children as the property of
the state rather than of the parents, and derided the
vanity of other nations, who studied to have horses of
the finest breed, yet had their children begotten by ordinary
persons rather than by the best and healthiest men.
At birth, the children were carried to be examined by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
the oldest men in council, who had the weaklings thrown
away into a cavern, and gave orders for the education of
the sturdy.</p>

<p>As for learning, they had just what was necessary
and no more, their education being directed chiefly to
making them obedient, laborious, and warlike. They
went barefoot, and for the most part naked. They were
trained to steal with astuteness, to suffer pain and hunger,
and to express themselves without an unnecessary
word. Dignified poetry and music were encouraged. To
the end of his life, the Spartan was kept ever in mind
that he was born, not for himself, but for his country;
the city was like one great camp, where each had his
stated allowance and his stated public charge.</p>

<p>Let us turn now to Numa Pompilius, the great law-giver
of the Romans. A Sabine of illustrious virtue and
great simplicity of life, he was elected to be king after
the interregnum which followed on the disappearance of
Romulus. He had spent much time in solitary wanderings
in the sacred groves and other retired places; and
there, it is reported, the goddess Egeria communicated
to him a happiness and knowledge more than mortal.</p>

<p>Numa was in his fortieth year, and was not easily persuaded
to undertake the Roman kingdom. But his disinclination
was overcome, and he was received with loud
acclamations as the most pious of men and most beloved
of the gods. His first act was to discharge the body-guard
provided for him, and to appoint a priest for the cult of
Romulus. But his great task was to soften the Romans,
as iron is softened by fire, and to bring them from a violent
and warlike disposition to a juster and more gentle
temper. For Rome was composed at first of most hardy
and resolute men, inveterate warriors.</p>

<p>To reduce this people to mildness and peace, he called
in the assistance of religion. By sacrifices, solemn
dances, and processions, wherein he himself officiated,
he mixed the charms of festal pleasure with holy ritual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
He founded the hierarchy of priests, the vestal virgins,
and several other sacred orders; and passed most of his
time in performing some religious function or in conversing
with the priests on some divine subject. And by
all this discipline the people became so tractable, and were
so impressed with Numa's power, that they would believe
the most fabulous tales, and thought nothing impossible
which he undertook. Numa further introduced agriculture,
and fostered it as an incentive to peace; he distributed
the citizens of Rome into guilds, or companies,
according to their several arts and trades; he reformed
the calendar, and did many other services to his people.</p>

<p>Comparing, now, Lycurgus and Numa, we find that
their resemblances are obvious&mdash;their wisdom, piety,
talent for government, and their deriving their laws from
a divine source. Of their distinctions, the chief is that
Numa accepted, but Lycurgus relinquished, a crown;
and as it was an honour to the former to attain royal
dignity by his justice, so it was an honour to the latter
to prefer justice to that dignity. Again, Lycurgus tuned
up the strings of Sparta, which he found relaxed with
luxury, to a keener pitch; Numa, on the contrary, softened
the high and harsh tone of Rome. Both were equally
studious to lead their people to sobriety, but Lycurgus
was more attached to fortitude and Numa to justice.</p>

<p>Though Numa put an end to the gain of rapine, he
made no provision against the accumulation of great
fortunes, nor against poverty, which then began to
spread within the city. He ought rather to have watched
against these dangers, for they gave birth to the many
troubles that befell the Roman state.</p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;Aristides and Cato</i></h4>

<p>Aristides had a close friendship with Clisthenes, who
established popular government in Athens after the expulsion
of the tyrants; yet he had at the same time a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
great veneration for Lycurgus of Sparta, whom he regarded
as supreme among law-givers; and this led him to
be a supporter of aristocracy, in which he was always
opposed by Themistocles, the democrat. The latter was
insinuating, daring, artful, and impetuous, but Aristides
was solid and steady, inflexibly just, and incapable of
flattery or deceit.</p>

<p>Neither elated by honour nor disheartened by ill success,
Aristides became deeply founded in the estimation
of the best citizens. He was appointed public treasurer,
and showed up the peculations of Themistocles and of
others who had preceded him. When the fleet of Darius
was at Marathon, with a view to subjugating Greece,
Miltiades and Aristides were the Greek generals, who by
custom were to command by turns, day about; and
Aristides freely gave up his command to the other, to
promote unity of discipline, and to give example of military
obedience. The next year he became archon.
Though a poor man and a commoner, Aristides won the
royal and divine title of "the Just." At first loved and
respected for his surname "the Just," Aristides came to
be envied and dreaded for so extraordinary an honour,
and the citizens assembled from all the towns in Attica
and banished him by ostracism, cloaking their envy of his
character under the pretence of guarding against tyranny.
Three years later they reversed this decree, fearing lest
Aristides should join the cause of Xerxes. They little
knew the man; even before his recall he had been inciting
the Greeks to defend their liberty.</p>

<p>In the great battle of PlatÃ¦a, Aristides was in command
of the Athenians; Pausanias, commander-in-chief
of all the confederates, joined him there with the Spartans.
The opposing Persian army covered an immense
area. In the engagements which took place the Greeks
behaved with the utmost firmness, and at last stormed
the Persian camp, with a prodigious slaughter of the
enemy. When, later, Aristides was entrusted with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
task of assessing the cities of the allies for a tax towards
the war, and was thus clothed with an authority which
made him master of Greece, though he set out poor he
returned yet poorer, having arranged the burden with
equal justice and humanity. In fact, he esteemed his
poverty no less a glory than all the laurels he had won.</p>

<p>The Roman counterpart of Aristides was Cato; which
name he received for his wisdom, for Romans call wise
men Catos. Marcus Cato, the censor, came of an obscure
family, yet his father and grandfather were excellent
soldiers. He lived on an estate which his father left him
near the Sabine country. With red hair and grey eyes,
his appearance was such, says an epigram, as to scare
the spirits of the departed. Inured to labour and temperance,
he had the sound constitution of one brought up
in camps; and he had practised eloquence as a necessary
instrument for one who would mix with affairs. While
still a lad he had fought in so many battles that his breast
was covered with scars; and all who spoke with him
noted a gravity of behaviour and a dignity of sentiment
such as to fit him for high responsibilities.</p>

<p>A powerful nobleman, Valerius Flaccus, whose estate
was near Cato's home, heard his servants praise their
neighbour's laborious life. He sent for Cato, and,
charmed with his sweet temper and ready wit, persuaded
him to go to Rome and apply himself to political affairs.
His rise was rapid; he became tribune of the soldiers,
then quÃ¦stor, and at last was the colleague of Valerius
both as consul and as censor.</p>

<p>Cato's eloquence brought him the epithet of the Roman
Demosthenes, but he was even more celebrated for his
manner of living. Few were willing to imitate him in
the ancient custom of tilling the ground with his own
hands, in eating a dinner prepared without fire, and a
spare, frugal supper; few thought it more honourable
not to want superfluities than to possess them. By reason
of its vast dominions, the commonwealth had lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
its pristine purity and integrity; the citizens were frightened
at labour and enervated by pleasure. But Cato
never wore a costly garment nor partook of an elaborate
meal; even when consul he drank the same wine as his
servants. He thought nothing cheap that is superfluous.
Some called him mean and narrow, others thought that
he was setting an object-lesson to the growing luxury of
the age. For my part, I think that his custom of using
his servants like beasts of burden, and of turning them off
or selling them when grown old, was the mark of an ungenerous
spirit, which thinks that the sole tie between
man and man is interest or necessity. For my own part,
I would not sell even an old ox that had laboured for me.</p>

<p>However that may be, his temperance was wonderful.
When governor of Sardinia, where his predecessors had
put the province to great expense, he did not even use a
carriage, but walked from town to town with one attendant.
He was inexorable in everything that concerned
public justice. He proved himself a brave general in
the field; and when he became censor, which was the
highest dignity of the republic, he waged an uncompromising
campaign against luxury, by means of an almost
prohibitive tax on the expenditure of ostentatious superfluity.
His style in speaking was at once humorous,
familiar, and forcible, and many of his wise and pregnant
sayings are remembered.</p>

<p>When we compare Aristides and Cato, we are at once
struck by many resemblances; and examining the several
parts of their lives distinctly, as we examine a poem
or a picture, we find that they both rose to great honour
without the help of family connections, and merely by
their own virtue and abilities. Both of them were
equally victorious in war; but in politics Aristides was less
successful, being banished by the faction of Themistocles;
while Cato, though his antagonists were the most powerful
men in Rome, kept his footing to the end like a skilled wrestler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
Again, Cato was no less attentive to the management
of his domestic affairs than he was to affairs of state,
and not only increased his own fortune, but became a
guide to others in finance and in agriculture. But Aristides,
by his indigence, brought disgrace upon justice
itself, as if it were the ruin and impoverishment of families;
it is even said that he left not enough for the
portions of his daughters nor for the expenses of his
own funeral. So Cato's family produced prÃ¦tors and
consuls to the fourth generation; but of the descendants
of Aristides some were conjurors and paupers, and not
one of them had a sentiment worthy of his illustrious
ancestor.</p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;Demosthenes and Cicero</i></h4>

<p>That these two great orators were originally formed
by nature in the same mould is shown by the similarity
of their dispositions. They had the same ambition, the
same love of liberty, and the same timidity in war and
danger. Their fortunes also were similar; both raised
themselves from obscure beginnings to authority and
power; both opposed kings and tyrants; both of them
were banished, then returned with honour, were forced
to fly again, and were taken by their enemies; and with
both of them expired the liberties of their countries.</p>

<p>Demosthenes, while a weakly child of seven years,
lost his father, and his fortune was dissipated by unworthy
guardians. But his ambition was fired in early
years by hearing the pleadings of the orator Callistratus,
and by noting the honours which attended success in that
profession. He at once applied himself to the practice of
declamation, and studied rhetoric under IsÃ¦us; and as
soon as he came of age he appeared at the Bar in the
prosecution of his guardians for their embezzlements.
Though successful in this claim, Demosthenes had much
to learn, and his earlier speeches provoked the amusement
of his audience. His manner was at once violent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
and confused, his voice weak and stammering, and his
delivery breathless; but these faults were overcome by
an arduous and protracted course of exercise in the
subterraneous study which he had built, where he would
remain for two or three months together. He corrected
the stammering by speaking with pebbles in his mouth;
strengthened his voice by running uphill and declaiming
while still unbreathed; and his attitude and gestures were
studied before a mirror.</p>

<p>Demosthenes was rarely heard to speak extempore,
and though the people called upon him in the assembly,
he would sit silent unless he had come prepared. He wrote
a great part, if not the whole, of each oration beforehand,
so that it was objected that his arguments "smelled of the
lamp"; yet, on exceptional occasions, he would speak unprepared,
and then as if from a supernatural impulse.</p>

<p>His nature was vindictive and his resentment implacable.
He was never a time-server in word or in action,
and he maintained to the end the political standpoint with
which he had begun. The glorious object of his ambition
was the defence of the cause of Greece against Philip;
and most of his orations, including these Philippics, are
written upon the principle that the right and worthy
course is to be chosen for its own sake. He does not
exhort his countrymen to that which is most agreeable,
or easy, or advantageous, but to that which is most honourable.
If, besides this noble ambition of his and the
lofty tone of his orations, he had been gifted also with
warlike courage and had kept his hands clean from
bribes, Demosthenes would have deserved to be numbered
with Cimon, Thucydides, and Pericles.</p>

<p>Cicero's wonderful genius came to light even in his
school-days; he had the capacity and inclination to learn
all the arts, but was most inclined to poetry, and the time
came when he was reputed the best poet as well as the
greatest orator in Rome. After a training in law and
some experience of the wars, he retired to a life of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
philosophic study, but being persuaded to appear in the
courts for Roscius, who was unjustly charged with the
murder of his father, Cicero immediately made his reputation
as an orator.</p>

<p>His health was weak; he could eat but little, and that
only late in the day; his voice was harsh, loud, and ill
regulated; but, like Demosthenes, he was able by assiduous
practice to modulate his enunciation to a full, sonorous,
and sweet tone, and his studies under the leading
rhetoricians of Greece and Asia perfected his eloquence.</p>

<p>His diligence, justice, and moderation were evidenced
by his conduct in public offices, as quÃ¦stor, prÃ¦tor, and
then as consul. In his attack on Catiline's conspiracy, he
showed the Romans what charms eloquence can add to
truth, and that justice is invincible when properly supported.
But his immoderate love of praise interrupted
his best designs, and he made himself obnoxious to many
by continually magnifying himself.</p>

<p>Demosthenes, by concentrating all his powers on the
single art of speaking, became unrivalled in the power,
grandeur, and accuracy of his eloquence. Cicero's studies
had a wider range; he strove to excel not only as an
orator, but as a philosopher and a scholar also. Their
difference of temperament is reflected in their styles.
Demosthenes is always grave and serious, an austere man
of thought; Cicero, on the other hand, loves his jest, and
is sometimes playful to the point of buffoonery. The
Greek orator never touches upon his own praise except
with some great point in view, and then does it modestly
and without offence; the Roman does not seek to hide his
intemperate vanity.</p>

<p>Both of these men had high political abilities; but
while the former held no public office, and lies under the
suspicion of having at times sold his talent to the highest
bidder, the latter ruled provinces as a pro-consul at a
time when avarice reigned unbridled, and became known
only for his humanity and his contempt of money.</p>

<h2 id="ch_276"><a name="MADAME_DE_STAEL" id="MADAME_DE_STAEL">MADAME DE STAÃ‹L</a></h2>

<h3>On Germany</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Madame de StaÃ«l's book "On Germany" (De l'Allemagne)
was finished in 1810. The manuscript was passed by the censor,
and partly printed, when the whole impression was seized by the
order of the Emperor and destroyed. Madame de StaÃ«l herself
escaped secretly, and came eventually to London, where, in 1813,
the work was published. She did not long survive the fall of her
tremendous enemy, Napoleon, but died in her beloved Paris on
July 14, 1817. When it is considered that "On Germany" was
written by other than an inhabitant of the country, and that
Madame de StaÃ«l did not travel far beyond her own residences
at Mainz, Frankfort, Berlin, and Vienna, the work may be reckoned
the most remarkable performance of its kind in literature
or biography (Mme. de StaÃ«l, biography: see Vol. VIII, p. 89).</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;Germany, Its People and Customs</i></h4>

<p>The multitude and extent of the forests indicate a still
new civilisation. Germany still shows traces of uninhabited
nature. It is a sad country, and time is needed to discover
what there is to love in it. The ruined castles on
the hills, the narrow windows of the houses, the long
stretches of snow in winter, the silence of nature and men,
all contribute towards the sadness. Yet the country and
its inhabitants are interesting and poetical. You feel that
human souls and imagination have embellished this land.</p>

<p>The only remarkable monuments in Germany are the
Gothic ones which recall the age of chivalry. Modern
German architecture is not worth mentioning, but the
towns are well built, and the people try to make their
houses look as cheerful and pleasing as possible. The
gardens in some parts of Germany are almost as beautiful
as in England, which denotes love of nature. Often,
in the midst of the superb gardens of the German princes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
Ã¦olian harps are placed; the breezes waft sound and scent
at once. Thus northern imagination tries to construct
Italian nature.</p>

<p>The Germans are generally sincere and faithful; they
scarcely ever break their word and are strangers to deception.
Power of work and thought is another of their
national traits. They are naturally literary and philosophical,
but their pride of class affects in some ways
their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit</i> adversely. The nobles are lacking in ideas,
and the men of letters know too little about business.
The Germans have imagination rather than <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit</i>.</p>

<p>The town dwellers and the country folk, the soldiers
and the workmen, nearly all have some knowledge of
music. I have been to some poor houses, blackened with
tobacco smoke, and not only the mistress, but also the
master of the house, improvise on the piano, just as the
Italians improvise in verse. Instrumental music is as
generally fostered in Germany as vocal music is in Italy.
Italy has the advantage, because instrumental music
requires work, whilst the southern sky suffices to produce
beautiful voices.</p>

<p>Peasant women and servants, who are too poor to put
on finery, decorate their hair with a few flowers, so that
imagination may at least enter into their attire.</p>

<p>One is constantly struck in Germany with the contrast
between sentiment and custom, between talent and taste;
civilisation and nature do not seem to have properly amalgamated
yet. Enthusiasm for art and poetry goes with
very vulgar habits in social life. Nothing could be more
bizarre than the combination of the warlike aspect of
Germany, where soldiers are met at every step, with the
indoor life led by the people. There is a dread of fatigue
and change of air, as if the nation were composed only of
shopkeepers and men of letters; and yet all the institutions
tend towards giving the nation military habits.</p>

<p>Stoves, beer, and tobacco-smoke crate around the German
people a kind of heavy and hot atmosphere which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
they do not like to leave. This atmosphere is injurious
to activity, which is at least as necessary in war as in
courage; resolutions are slow, discouragement is easy,
because a generally sad existence does not engender
much confidence in fortune.</p>

<p>Three motive powers lead men to fight: love of the
fatherland and of liberty, love of glory, and religious
fanaticism. There is not much love of the fatherland in
an Empire that has been divided for centuries, where
Germans fought against Germans; love of glory is not
very lively where there is no centre, no capital, no society.
The Germans are much more apt to get roused by abstract
ideas than by the interests of life.</p>

<p>The love of liberty is not developed with the Germans;
they have learnt neither by enjoyment, nor by privation,
the prize that may be attached to it. The very independence
enjoyed by Germany in all respects made the
Germans indifferent to liberty; independence is a possession,
liberty a guarantee, and just because nobody was
crossed in Germany either in his rights or in his pleasures,
nobody felt the need for an order of things that
would maintain this happiness.</p>

<p>The Germans, with few exceptions, are scarcely capable
of succeeding in anything that requires cleverness
and skill; everything troubles them, makes them nervous,
and they need method in action as well as independence
in thought.</p>

<p>German women have a charm of their own, a touching
quality of voice, fair hair, and brilliant complexion;
they are modest, but not as shy as the English. One can
see that they have often met men who were superior to
them, and that they have less cause to fear the severity
of public judgment. They try to please by their sensibility,
and to arouse interest by the imagination. The
language of poetry and of the fine arts is known to them;
they flirt with enthusiasm, just as one flirts in France
with <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit</i> and wit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
Love is a religion in Germany, but a poetic religion,
which willingly tolerates all that may be excused by sensibility.
The facility of divorce in the Protestant provinces
certainly affects the sanctity of marriage. Husbands
are changed as peacefully as if it were merely a
question of arranging the incidents of a play. The good-nature
of men and women prevents any bitterness entering
these easy ruptures.</p>

<p>Some German women are ever in a state of exaltation
that amounts to affectation, and the sweet expressions
of which efface whatever there may be piquant or pronounced
in their mind and character. They are not frank,
and yet not false either; but they see and judge nothing
with truth, and the real events pass before their eyes like
phantasmagoria.</p>

<p>But these women are the exception. Many German
women have true sentiment and simple manners. Their
careful education and natural purity of soul renders their
dominion gentle and moderate; every day they inspire
you with increased interest for all that is great and noble,
with increased confidence in every kind of hope. What
is rare among German women is real <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit</i> and quick
repartee. Conversation, as a talent, exists only in France;
in other countries it only serves for polite intercourse, for
discussion and for friendship; in France it is an art.</p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;On Southern Germany and Austria</i></h4>

<p>Franconia, Suabia, and Bavaria were, before the
foundation of the Munich Academy, strangely heavy and
monotonous countries; no arts except music, little literature;
an accent that did not lend itself well to the pronunciation
of the Latin languages, no society; great
parties that resembled ceremonies rather than amusement;
obsequious politeness towards an unelegant aristocracy;
kindness and loyalty in all classes, but a certain
smiling stiffness which is neither ease nor dignity. In a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
country where society counts for nothing, and nature for
little, only the literary towns can be really interesting.</p>

<p>A temperate climate is not favourable for poetry.
Where the climate is neither severe nor beautiful, one
lives without fearing or hoping anything from heaven,
and one only takes interest in the positive facts of existence.
Southern Germany, temperate in every respect,
keeps up a state of monotonous well-being which is as
bad for business activity as it is for the activity of the
mind. The keenest wish of the inhabitants of that peaceful
and fertile country is to continue the same existence.
And what can one do with that one desire? It is not
even enough to preserve that with which one is contented.</p>

<p>There are many excellent things in Austria, but few
really superior men, because in that country it is not
much use to excel one's neighbour; one is not envied for
it, but forgotten, which is still more discouraging. Ambition
turns in the direction of obtaining good posts.</p>

<p>Austria, embracing so many different peoples, Bohemians,
Hungarians, etc., has not the unity necessary for a
monarchy. Yet the great moderation of the heads of
the state has for a long time constituted a strong link.</p>

<p>Industry, good living and domestic pleasures are
Austria's principal interests. In spite of the glory she
gained by the perseverance and valour of her troops, the
military spirit has really never got hold of all classes of
the nation.</p>

<p>In a country where every movement is difficult, and
where everything inspires tranquility, the slightest obstacle
is an excuse for complete idleness of action and
thought. One might say that this is real happiness; but
does happiness consist of the faculties which one develops,
or of those which one chokes?</p>

<p>Vienna is situated in a plain amid picturesque hills.
It is an old town, very small, but surrounded by very
spacious suburbs. It is said that the city proper within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
the fortifications is no larger than it was when Richard
CÅ“ur-de-Lion was put into prison not far from its gates.
The streets are as narrow as in Italy; the palaces recall
a little those of Florence; in fine, nothing here resembles
the rest of Germany except a few Gothic buildings, which
bring back the Middle Ages to the imagination. First
among these is the tower of St. Stephen's, around which
somehow centres the whole history of Austria. No
building can be as patriotic as a church&mdash;the only one
in which all classes of the population meet, the only one
which recalls not only the public events, but also the
secret thoughts, the intimate affections which the rulers
and the citizens have brought within its precincts.</p>

<p>Every great city has some building, or promenade,
some work of art or nature, to which the recollections
of childhood are attached. It seems to me that the
<i>Prater</i> should have this charm for the Viennese. No
other city can match this splendid promenade through
woods and deer-stocked meadows. The daily promenade
at a fixed hour is an Italian custom. Such regularity
would be impossible in a country where the pleasures
are as varied as in Paris; but the Viennese could never
do without it. Society folk in their carriages and the
people on their feet assemble here every evening. It is
in the Prater that one is most struck with the easy life
and the prosperity of the Viennese. Vienna has the
uncontested reputation of consuming more food than
any other equally populous city. You can see whole
families of citizens and artisans starting for the Prater
at five o'clock for a rustic meal as substantial as dinner
in any other country, and the money they are able to
spend on it proves their industry and kindly rule.</p>

<p>At night thousands of people return, without disorder,
without quarrel. You can scarcely hear a voice, so
silently do they take their pleasures. It is not due to
sadness, but to laziness and physical well-being. Society
is here with magnificent horses and carriages. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
whole amusement is to recognise in a Prater avenue
the friends they have just left in a drawing-room. The
emperor and his brothers take their place in the long
row of carriages, and prefer to be considered just as
ordinary private people. They only use their rights when
they are performing their duties. You never see a beggar:
the charity institutions are admirably managed.
And there are very few mortal crimes in Austria. Everything
in this country bears the impress of a paternal,
wise, and religious government.</p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;On the German Language</i></h4>

<p>Germany is better suited for prose than for poetry,
and the prose is better written than spoken; it is an
excellent instrument if you wish to describe or to say
everything; but you cannot playfully pass from subject
to subject as you can in French. If you would adapt the
German words to the French style of conversation you
would rob them altogether of grace and dignity. The
merit of the Germans is to fill their time well; the talent
of the French is to make us forget time.</p>

<p>Although the sense of German sentences is frequently
only revealed at the very end, the construction does not
always permit to close a phrase with the most piquant
expression, which is one of the great means to make
conversation effective. You rarely hear among the Germans
what is known as a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon-mot</i>; you have to admire
the thought and not the brilliant way in which it is expressed.</p>

<p>Brilliant expression is considered a kind of charlatanism
by the Germans, who take to abstract expression
because it is more conscientious and approaches more
closely to the very essence of truth. But conversation
ought not to cause any trouble either to the listener or
to the speaker. As soon as conversation in Germany
departs from the ordinary interests of life it becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
too metaphysical; there is nothing between the common
and the sublime; and it is just this intermediate region
that is the proper sphere for the art of conversation.</p>

<h5>WEIMAR</h5>

<p>Of all the German principalities, Weimar makes one
best realise the advantages of a small country, if the
ruler is a man of fine intellect who may try to please his
subjects without losing their obedience. The Duchess
Louise of Saxe-Weimar is the true model of a woman
destined for high rank. The duke's military talents are
highly esteemed; his conversation is pointed and well
considered; his intellect and his mother's have attracted
the most distinguished men of letters to Weimar. Germany
had for the first time a literary capital.</p>

<p>Herder had just died when I arrived at Weimar, but
Wieland, Goethe, and Schiller were still there. They
can be judged from their works, for their books bear a
striking resemblance to their character and conversation.</p>

<p>Life in small towns has never appealed to me. Man's
intellect seems to become narrow and woman's heart
cold. One feels oppressed by the close proximity of
one's equals. All the actions of your life are minutely
examined in detail, until the ensemble of your character
is no longer understood. And the more your spirit is
independent and elevated, the less you can breathe within
the narrow confines. This disagreeable discomfort did
not exist at Weimar, which was not a little town, but a
large castle. A chosen circle took a lively interest in
every new art production. Imagination, constantly stimulated
by the conversation of the poets, felt less need
for those outside distractions which lighten the burden
of existence but often dissipates its forces. Weimar has
been called the Athens of Germany, and rightly so. It
was the only place where interest in the fine arts was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
so to speak, rational and served as fraternal link between
the different ranks.</p>

<h4><i>IV.&mdash;Prussia</i></h4>

<p>To know Prussia, one has to study the character of
Frederick II. A man has created this empire which had
not been favoured by nature, and which has only become
a power because a soldier has been its master. There are
two distinct men in Frederick II.: a German by nature,
and a Frenchman by education. All that the German did
in a German kingdom has left lasting traces; all that the
Frenchman tried has been fruitless.</p>

<p>Frederick's great misfortune was that he had not
enough respect for religion and customs. His tastes
were cynical. Frederick, in liberating his subjects of
what he called prejudices, stifled in them their patriotism,
for in order to get attached to a naturally sombre
and sterile country one must be ruled by very stern
opinions and principles. Frederick's predilection for war
may be excused on political grounds. His realm, as he
took it over from his father, could not exist, and aggrandisement
was necessary for its preservation. He
had two and a half million subjects when he ascended
the throne, and he left six millions on his death.</p>

<p>One of his greatest wrongs was his share in the
division of Poland. Silesia was acquired by force of
arms. Poland by Macchiavellian conquest, "and one
could never hope that subjects thus robbed should be
faithful to the juggler who called himself their sovereign."</p>

<p>Frederick II. wanted French literature to rule alone
in his country, and had no consideration for German
literature, which, no doubt, was then not as remarkable
as it is to-day; but a German prince should encourage
all that is German. Frederick wanted to make Berlin
resemble Paris, and he flattered himself to have found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
among the French refugees some writers of sufficient
distinction to have a French literature. Such hope was
bound to be deceptive. Artificial culture never prospers;
a few individuals may fight against the natural difficulties,
but the masses will always follow their natural
leaning. Frederick did a real wrong to his country when
he professed to despise German genius.</p>

<h5>BERLIN</h5>

<p>Berlin is a large town, with wide, long, straight streets,
beautiful houses, and an orderly aspect; but as it has
only recently been rebuilt, it contains nothing to recall
the past. No Gothic monument exists among the modern
dwellings, and this newly-formed country is in no way
interfered with by the past. But modern Berlin, with
all its beauty, does not impress me seriously. It tells
nothing of the history of the country or the character of
its inhabitants; and these beautiful new houses seem to
be destined only for the comfortable gatherings of business
or industry. The most beautiful palaces of Berlin
are built of brick. Prussia's capital resembles Prussia
herself; its buildings and institutions have the age of one
generation, and no more, because one man alone is their
creator.</p>

<h2 id="ch_286"><a name="THE_GERMANIA_OF_TACITUS" id="THE_GERMANIA_OF_TACITUS">THE "GERMANIA" OF TACITUS</a></h2>

<h3>Customs and Peoples of Germany</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"Germania," the full title of which is "Concerning the
Geography, the Manners and Customs, and the Peoples of
Germany," consists of forty-six sections, the first twenty-seven
describing the characteristics of the peoples, their customs, beliefs,
and institutions; the remaining nineteen dealing with the
individual peculiarities of each separate tribe. As a record of
the Teutonic tribes, written purely from an ethical and rhetorical
standpoint, the work is of the utmost importance, and, on the
whole, is regarded as trustworthy. Its weak point is its geography,
details of which Tacitus (see Vol. XI, p. 156) no doubt
gathered from hearsay. The main object of the work was not
so much to compose a history of Germany, as to draw a comparison
between the independence of the Northern peoples and
the corrupt civilisation of contemporary Roman life. Possibly,
also, Tacitus intended to sound a note of alarm.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;Germany and the German Tribes</i></h4>

<p>The whole of Germany is thus bounded. It is separated
from Gaul, RhÃ¦tia, and Pannonia by the rivers
Rhine and Danube; from Sarmatia and Dacia by mutual
fear, or by high mountains; the rest is encompassed by
the ocean, which forms vast bays and contains many large
islands. The Rhine, rising from a rocky summit in the
RhÃ¦tian Alps, winds westward, and is lost in the northern
ocean. The Danube, issuing from Mount Abnoba,
traverses several countries and finally falls into the
Euxine.</p>

<p>I believe that the population is indigenous to Germany,
and that the nation is free from foreign admixture. They
affirm Germany to be a recent word, lately bestowed on
those who first passed the Rhine and repulsed the Gauls.
From one tribe the whole nation has thus been named.
They cherish a tradition that Hercules had been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
their country, and him they extol in their battle songs.
Some are of opinion that Ulysses also, during his long
wanderings, was carried into this ocean and entered
Germany, and that he founded the city Asciburgium,
which stands at this day upon the bank of the Rhine.
Such traditions I purpose myself neither to confirm nor
to refute; but I agree with those who maintain that the
Germans have never intermingled by marriages with
other nations, but have remained a pure, independent
people, resembling none but themselves.</p>

<p>With whatever differences in various districts, their
territory mainly consists of gloomy forests or insalubrious
marshes, lower and more humid towards Gaul,
more hilly and bleak towards Noricum and Pannonia.
The soil is suited to the production of grain, but less so
for the cultivation of fruits. Flocks and herds abound,
but the cattle are somewhat small. Their herds are their
most valued possessions. Silver and gold the gods have
denied them, whether in mercy or in wrath I cannot determine.
Nor is iron plentiful with them, as may be
judged from their weapons. Swords or long spears they
rarely use, for they fight chiefly with javelins and shields.
Their strength lies mainly in their foot, and such is
the swiftness of the infantry that it can suit and match
the motions and engagements of the cavalry.</p>

<p>Generals are chosen for their courage, kings are elected
through distinction of race. The power of the rulers is
not unlimited or arbitrary, and the generals secure obedience
mainly by force of the example of their own
enterprise and bravery.</p>

<p>Therefore, when going on a campaign, they carry with
them sacred images taken from the sacred groves. It is
their custom also to flock to the field of war not merely
in battalions, but with whole families and tribes of relations.
Thus, close to the scene of conflict are lodged
the most cherished pledges of nature, and the cries of
wives and infants are heard mingling with the echoes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
battle. Their wounds and injuries they carry to their
mothers and wives, and the women administer food and
encouragement to their husbands and sons even while
these are engaged in fighting.</p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;Customs of Government and War</i></h4>

<p>Mercury is the god most generally worshipped. To
him at certain times it is lawful to offer even human sacrifices.
Hercules, Mars, and Isis are also recognised as
deities. From the majesty of celestial beings, the Germans
judge it to be unsuitable to hold their shrines within
walls, or to represent them under any human likeness.
They therefore consecrate whole woods and groves, and
on these sylvan retreats they bestow the names of the
deities, thus beholding the divinities only in contemplation
and mental reverence.</p>

<p>Although the chiefs regulate affairs of minor import,
the whole nation deliberates concerning matters of higher
consequence, the chiefs afterwards discussing the public
decision. The assemblies gather leisurely, for sometimes
many do not arrive for two or three days. The priests
enjoin silence, and on them is devolved the prerogative
of correction. The chiefs are heard according to precedence,
or age, or nobility, or warlike celebrity, or
eloquence. Ability to persuade has more influence than
authority to command. Inarticulate murmurs express
displeasure at a proposition, pleasure is indicated by the
brandishing of javelins and the clashing of arms.</p>

<p>Punishments vary with the character of crime. Traitors
and deserters are hanged on trees; cowards, sluggards,
and vicious women are smothered in bogs. Fines,
to be paid in horses or cattle, are exacted for lighter
offences, part of the mulct being awarded to the party
wronged, part to the chief.</p>

<p>The Germans transact no business without carrying
arms, but no man thus bears weapons till the community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
has tested his capacity to wield them. When the public
approval has been signified, the youth is invested in the
midst of the assembly by his father or other relative with
a shield and javelin.</p>

<p>Their chief distinction is to be constantly surrounded
by a great band of select young men, for their honour
in peace and their help in warfare.</p>

<p>In battle it is disgraceful to a chief to be surpassed in
feats of bravery, and it is an indelible reproach to his
followers to return alive from a conflict in which their
prince has been slain. The chief fights for victory, his
followers fight for him. The Germans are so restless
that they cannot endure repose, and thus many of the
young men of rank, if their own tribe is tranquil, quit it
for a community which happens to be engaged in war.
In place of pay the retainers are supplied with daily repasts,
grossly prepared, but always profuse.</p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;Domestic Customs of the Germans</i></h4>

<p>Intervals of peace are not much devoted to the chase
by the Germans, but rather to indolence, to sleep, and to
feasting. Many surrender themselves entirely to sloth
and gluttony, the cares of house, lands, and possessions
being left to the wives. It is an astonishing paradox that
in the same men should co-exist so much delight in idleness
and so great a repugnance to tranquil life.</p>

<p>The Germans do not dwell in cities, and endure no
contiguity in their abodes, inhabiting spots distinct and
apart, just as they fancy, a fountain, a grove, or a field.
Their villages consist of houses arranged in opposite
rows, not joined together as are ours. Each is detached,
with space around, and mortar and tiles are unknown.
Many, in winter, retreat to holes dug in the ground, to
which they convey their grain.</p>

<p>The laws of matrimony are strictly observed, and polygamy
is rarely practised among the Germans. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
dowry is not brought by the wife, but by the husband.
Conjugal infidelity is exceedingly rare, and is instantly
punished. In all families the children are reared without
clothing, and thus grow into those physical proportions
which are so wonderful to look upon. They are invariably
suckled by their mothers, never being entrusted to
nursemaids. The young people do not hasten to marry,
and thus the robust vigour of the parents is inherited by
their offspring.</p>

<p>No nation was ever more noted for hospitality. It is
esteemed inhuman to refuse to admit to the home any
stranger whatever. Every comer is willingly received
and generously feasted. Hosts and guests delight in
exchanging gifts. To continue drinking night and day is
no reproach to any man. Quarrels through inebriety are
very frequent, and these often result in injuries and in
fatalities. But likewise, in these convivial feasts they
usually deliberate about effecting reconciliation between
those who are at enmity, and also about forming affinities,
the election of chiefs, and peace and war.</p>

<p>Slaves gained in gambling with dice are exchanged in
commerce to remove the shame of such victories. Of
their other slaves each has a dwelling of his own, his
lord treating him like a tenant, exacting from him an
amount of grain, or cattle, or cloth. Thus their slaves
are not subservient as are ours. For they do not perform
services in the households of their masters, these
duties falling to the wives and children of the family.
Slaves are rarely seen in chains or punished with stripes,
though in the heat of passion they may sometimes be
killed.</p>

<p>Usury and borrowing at interest are unknown. The
families every year shift on the spacious plains, cultivating
fresh allotments of the soil. Only corn is grown, for
there is no inclination to expend toil proportionate to the
capacity of the lands by planting orchards, or enclosing
meadows, or watering gardens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Their funerals are not ostentatious, neither apparel
nor perfumes being accumulated on the pile, though the
arms of the deceased are thrown into the fire. Little
demonstration is made in weeping or wailing, but the
grief endures long. So much concerning the customs of
the whole German nation.</p>

<h4><i>IV.&mdash;Tribes of the West and North</i></h4>

<p>I shall now describe the institutions of the several
tribes, as they differ from one another, giving also an
account of those who from thence removed, migrating to
Gaul. That the Gauls were more powerful in former
times is shown by that prince of authors, the deified
Julius CÃ¦sar. Hence it is probable that they have passed
into Germany.</p>

<p>The region between the Hercynian forest and the
rivers Maine and Rhine was occupied by the Helvetians,
as was that beyond it by the Boians, both Gallic tribes.
The Treveri and Nervii fervently aspire to the reputation
of descent from the Germans, and the Vangiones,
Triboci, and Nemetes, all dwelling by the Rhine, are certainly
all Germans. The Ubii are ashamed of their origin
and delight to be called Agrippinenses, after the name
of the founder of the Roman colony which they were
judged worthy of being constituted.</p>

<p>The Batavi are the bravest of all these nations. They
inhabit a little territory by the Rhine, but possess an
island on it. Becoming willingly part of the Roman
empire, they are free from all impositions and pay no
tribute, but are reserved wholly for wars, precisely like
a magazine of weapons and armour. In the same position
are the Mattiaci, living on the opposite banks and enjoying
a settlement and limits of their own, while they
are in spirit and inclination attached to us.</p>

<p>Beginning at the Hercynian forest are the Catti, a
robust and vigorous people, possessed also of much sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
and ability. They are not only singularly brave, but are
more skilled in the true art of war than other Germans.</p>

<p>Near the Catti were formerly dwelling the Bructeri,
in whose stead are now settled the Chamani and the
Angrivarii, by whom the Bructeri were expelled and
almost exterminated, to the benefit of us Romans. May
the gods perpetuate among these nations their mutual
hatred, since fortune befriends our empire by sowing
strife amongst our foes!</p>

<p>The country of the Frisii, facing that of the Angrivarii
and the Chamani, is divided into two sections, called the
greater and the lesser, which both extend along the Rhine
to the ocean.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have been describing Germany towards the
west. Northward it stretches with an immense compass.
The great tribe of the Chauci occupy the whole region
between the districts of the Frisii and of the Catti. These
Chauci are the noblest people of all the Germans. They
prefer to maintain their greatness by justice rather than
by violence, seeking to live in tranquillity, and to avoid
quarrels with others.</p>

<p>By the side of the Chauci and the Catti dwell the
Cherusci, a people who have degenerated in both influence
and character. Finding no enemy to stimulate them,
they were enfeebled by too lasting a peace, and whereas
they were formerly styled good and upright, they are
now called cowards and fools, having been subdued by
the Catti. In the same winding tract live the Cimbri, close
to the sea, a tribe now small in numbers but great in fame
for many monuments of their old renown. It was in the
610th year of Rome, CÃ¦cilius Metellus and Papirius
Carbo being consuls, that the first mention was made of
the arms of the Cimbri. From that date to the second
consulship of the Emperor Trajan comprehends an interval
of nearly 210 years; so long a period has our conquest
of Germany occupied. In so great an interval many have
been the disasters on both sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
Indeed, not from the Samnites, or from the Carthaginians,
or from the people of Spain, or from all the tribes
of Gaul, or even from the Parthians, have we received
more checks or encountered more alarms. For the
passion of the Germans for liberty is more indomitable
than that of the ArsacidÃ¦. What has the power of the
East to lay to our dishonour? But the overthrow and
abasement of Crassus, and the loss by the Romans of
five great armies, all commanded by consuls, have to be
laid to the account of the Germans. By the Germans,
also, even the Emperor Augustus was deprived of Varus
and three legions.</p>

<p>Only with great difficulty and the loss of many men
were the Germans defeated by Caius Marius in Italy, or
by the deified Julius CÃ¦sar in Gaul, or by Drusus, or
Tiberius, or Germanicus in their native territories. And
next, the strenuous menaces of Caligula against these
foes ended in mockery and ridicule. Afterwards, for a
season they were quiet, till, tempted to take advantage
of our domestic schisms and civil wars, they stormed and
seized the winter entrenchments of our legions, and
attempted the conquest of Gaul. Though they were once
more repulsed, our success was rather a triumph than
an overwhelming victory.</p>

<h4><i>V.&mdash;The Great Nation of the Suevi</i></h4>

<p>Next I must refer to the Suevi, who are not, like the
Catti, a homogeneous people, but are divided into several
tribes, all bearing distinct names, although they likewise
are called by the generic title of Suevi. They occupy the
larger part of Germany. From other Germans they are
distinguished by their peculiar fashion of twisting their
hair into a knot, this also marking the difference between
the freemen and their slaves. Of all the tribes of the
Suevi, the Semnones esteem themselves to be the most
ancient and the noblest, their faith in their antiquity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
being confirmed by the mysteries of their religion. Annually
in a sacred grove the deputies of each family clan
assemble to repeat the rites practised by their ancestors.
The horrible ceremonies commence with the sacrifice of
a man. Their tradition is that at this spot the nation
originated, and that here the supreme deity resides.
The Semnones inhabit a hundred towns, and by their
superior numbers and authority dominate the rest of the
Suevi.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the Langobardi are ennobled by the
paucity of their number, for, though surrounded by
powerful tribes, they assert their superiority by their
valour and skill instead of displaying obsequiousness.
Next come the Reudigni, the Aviones, the Angli, the
Varini, the Eudoses, the Suardones and the Nuithones,
all defended by rivers or forests.</p>

<p>These are marked by no special characteristics, excepting
the common worship of the goddess Nerthum, or
Mother Earth, of whom they believe that she not only
intervenes in human affairs, but also visits the nations.
In a certain island of the sea is a wood called Castum.
Here is kept a chariot sacred to the goddess, covered with
a curtain, and permitted to be touched only by her priest,
who perceives her whenever she enters the holy vehicle,
and with deepest veneration attends the motion of the
chariot, which is always drawn by yoked cows. Till the
same priests re-conducts the goddess to her shrine, after
she has grown weary of intercourse with mortals, feasts
and games are held with great rejoicings, no arms are
touched, and none go to war. Slaves wash the chariot
and curtains in a sacred lake, and, if you will believe it,
the goddess herself; and forthwith these unfortunate
beings are doomed to be swallowed up in the same lake.</p>

<p>This portion of the Suevian territory stretches to the
centre of Germany. Next adjoining is the district of
the Hermunduri (I am now following the course of the
Danube as I previously did that of the Rhine), a tribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
faithful to the Romans. To them, accordingly, alone of
all the Germans, is commerce permitted. They travel
everywhere at their own discretion. When to others we
show nothing more than our arms and our encampments,
to this people we open our houses, as to men who are not
longing to possess them. The Elbe rises in the territory
of the Hermunduri.</p>

<h4><i>VI.&mdash;The Tribes of the Frontier</i></h4>

<p>Near the Hermunduri reside the Narisci, and next the
Marcomanni and the Quadi, the former being the more
famed for strength and bravery, for it was by force
that they acquired their location, expelling from it the
Boii. Now, here is, as it were, the frontier of Germany,
as far as it is washed by the Danube. Not less powerful
are several tribes whose territories enclose the lands of
those just named&mdash;the Marsigni, the Gothini, the Osi,
and the Burii. The Marsigni in speech and dress resemble
the Suevi; but as the Gothini speak Gallic, and
the Osi the Pannonian language, and as they endure the
imposition of tribute, it is manifest that neither of these
peoples are Germans.</p>

<p>Upon them, as aliens, tribute is imposed, partly by the
SarmatÃ¦, partly by the Quadi, and, to deepen their disgrace,
the Gothini are forced to labour in the iron mines.
Little level country is possessed by all these several
tribes, for they are located among mountainous forest
regions, Suevia being parted by a continuous range of
mountains, beyond which live many nations. Of these,
the most numerous and widely spread are the Lygii.
Among others, the most powerful are the Arii, the HelveconÃ¦,
the Manimi, the Elysii, and the Naharvali.</p>

<p>The Arii are the most numerous, and also the fiercest
of the tribes just enumerated. They carry black shields,
paint their bodies black, and choose dark nights for engaging
in battle. The ghastly aspect of their army strikes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
terror into their foes, for in all battles the eyes are
vanquished first. Beyond the Lygii dwell the Gothones,
ruled by a king, and thus held in stricter subjection than
the other German tribes, yet not so that their liberties
are extinguished. Immediately adjacent are the Rugii
and the Lemovii, dwelling by the coast. The characteristic
of both is the use of a round shield and a short
sword.</p>

<p>Next are the Suiones, a seafaring community with
very powerful fleets. The ships differ in form from ours
in possessing prows at each end, so as to be always
ready to row to shore without turning. They are not
propelled by sails, and have no benches of oars at the
sides. The rowers ply in all parts of the ship alike, and
change their oars from place to place according as the
course is shifted hither and thither. Great homage is
paid among them to wealth; they are governed by a
single chief, who exacts implicit obedience. Arms are
not used by these people indiscriminately, as by other
German tribes. Weapons are shut up under the care
of a slave. The reason is that the ocean always protects
the Suiones from their foes, and also that armed bands,
when not employed, grow easily demoralised.</p>

<p>Beyond the Suiones is another sea, dense and calm.
It is thought that by this the whole globe is bounded,
for the reflection of the sun, after his setting, continues
till he rises, and that so radiantly as to obscure the stars.
Popular opinion even adds that the tumult is heard of
his emerging from the ocean, and that at sunrise forms
divine are seen, and also the rays about his head. Only
thus far extend the limits of Nature, if what fame
reports be true.</p>

<p>The Ã†stii reside on the right of the Suevian Sea.
Their dress and customs resemble those of the Suevi,
but the language is akin to that of Britain. They worship
the Mother of gods, and wear images of boars,
without any weapons, superstitiously trusting the goddess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
and the images to safeguard them. But they cultivate
the soil with much greater zeal than is usual
with Germans, and they even search the ocean, and are
the only people who gather amber, which they find in
the shallows and along the shore. It lay long neglected
till it gained value from our luxury.</p>

<p>Bordering on the Suiones are the Sitones, agreeing
with them in all things excepting that they are governed
by a woman. So emphatically have they degenerated,
not merely from liberty, but even below a condition of
bondage. Here end the territories of the Suevi.
Whether I ought to include the Peucini, the Venedi, and
the Fenni among the SarmatÃ¦ or the Germani I cannot
determine, although the Peucini speak the same language
with the Germani, dress, build, and live like them,
and resemble them in dirt and sloth.</p>

<p>What further accounts we have are fabulous, and
these I leave untouched.</p>

<h3>History of English Literature</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Two years before the appearance of his "Histoire de la LittÃ©rature
Anglaise" Taine had aroused a lively interest in England
by his "Notes sur l'Angleterre," a work showing much
wayward sympathy for the English character, and an irregular
understanding of English institutions. The same mixed impression
was produced by the laboriously conceived and brilliantly
written "History of English Literature." Taine (see Vol. XXIV,
p. 177) wrote to a theory that often worked out into curious contradictions.
His method was to show how men have been shaped
by the environments and tendencies of their age. Unfortunately,
having formed an idea of the kind of literature our age should
produce according to his theory, he had eyes for nothing except
what he expected to find. He went to literature for his confirmations
of his reading of history. Taine's criticism, in consequence,
is often incomplete, and more piquant than trustworthy. The
failure to appreciate some of the great English writers&mdash;notably
Shakespeare and Milton&mdash;is patent. Still, the critic always had
the will to be just, and no foreigner has devoted such complimentary
labour to the formation of a complete estimate of English
literature. The book was published in 1863&ndash;4.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>Saxon and Norman</i></h4>

<p>History has been revolutionised by the study of
literatures. A work of literature is now perceived, not
to be a solitary caprice, but a transcript of contemporary
manners, from which we may read the style of man's
feelings for centuries back. By the study of a literature,
one may construct a moral history, the psychology of a
people. To find a complete literature is rare. Only
ancient Greece, and modern France and England offer
a complete series of great literary monuments. I have
chosen England because it is alive, and one can see it
with more detachment than one can see France.</p>

<p>Huge white bodies, cool-blooded, with fierce blue eyes,
reddish flaxen hair; ravenous stomachs filled with meat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
and cheese and heated by strong drinks; a cold temperament,
slow to love, home-staying, prone to drunkenness&mdash;these
are to this day the features which descent and
climate preserve to the English race. The heavy human
brute gluts himself with sensations and noise, and this
appetite finds a grazing-ground in blows and battle.
Strife for strife's sake such is their pleasure. A race so
constituted was predisposed to Christianity by its gloom,
and beyond Christianity foreign culture could not graft
any fruitful branch on this barbarous stock. The Norman
conquerors of France had by intermarriage become
a Latin race, and nimbly educated themselves from the
Gauls, who boasted of "talking with ease." When they
crossed to England, they introduced new manners and a
new spirit. They taught the Saxon how ideas fall in
order, and which ideas are agreeable; they taught him
how to be clear, amusing, and pungent. At length, after
long impotence of Norman literature, which was content
to copy, and of Saxon literature, which bore no fruit,
a definite language was attained, and there was room for
a great writer.</p>

<h4><i>Chaucer</i></h4>

<p>Then Geoffrey Chaucer appeared, inventive though a
disciple, original though a translator, and by his genius,
education, and life was enabled to know and depict a
whole world, but above all to satisfy the chivalric world
and the splendid courts which shone upon the heights.
He belonged to it, and took such part in it that his life
from end to end was that of a man of the world and a
man of action.</p>

<p>Two motives raised the middle age above the chaos of
barbarism, one religious, which fashioned the gigantic
cathedrals, the other secular, which built the feudal fortresses.
The one produced the adventurous hero, the
other the mystical monk. These master-passions gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
way at last to monotony of habit and taste for worldliness.
Something was then needed to make the evening
hours flow sweetly. The lords at table have finished
dinner; the poet arrives; they ask him for his subject,
and he answers "Love."</p>

<p>There is something more pleasant than a fine narrative,
and that is a collection of fine narratives, especially
when the narratives are all of different colouring. This
collection Chaucer gave us, and more. If over-excited,
he is always graceful, polished, full of light banter, half-mockeries,
somewhat gossipy. An elegant speaker, facile,
every ready to smile, he makes of love not a passion
but a gay feast. But if he was romantic and gay after
the fashion of his age, he also had a fashion of his own.
He observes characters, notes their differences, studies
the coherence of their parts, brings forward living and
distinct persons&mdash;a thing unheard of in his time. It is
the English positive good sense and aptitude for seeing
the inside of things beginning to appear. Chaucer ceases
to gossip, and thinks. Each tale is suited to the teller.
Instead of surrendering himself to the facility of glowing
improvisation, he plans. All his tales are bound together
by veritable incidents which spring from the characters
of the personages, and are such as we light upon in our
travels. He advanced beyond the threshold of his art,
but he paused in the vestibule. He half-opens the door
of the temple, but does not take his seat there; at most
he sat down at intervals. His voice is like that of a boy
breaking into manhood. He sets out as if to quit the
middle ages; but in the end he is still there.</p>

<h4><i>The Renaissance</i></h4>

<p>For seventeen centuries a deep and sad thought had
weighed upon the spirit of man&mdash;the idea of his impotence
and decadence. Greek corruption, Roman oppression,
and the dissolution of the old world had given it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
birth; it, in its turn, had produced a stoical resignation,
an epicurean indifference, Alexandrian mysticism, and
the Christian hope in the Kingdom of God. At last
invention makes another start. All was renewed, America
and the Indies were added to the map. The system
of the universe was propounded, the experimental sciences
were set on foot, art and literature shot forth like
a harvest, and religion was transformed. It seems as
though men had suddenly opened their eyes and seen.
They attained a new and superior kind of intelligence
which produced extraordinary warmth of soul, a super-abundant
and splendid imagination, reveries, visions,
artists, believers, founders, creators. This was Europe's
grand age, and the most notable epoch of human growth.
To this day we live from its sap. To vent the feelings,
to set free boldly on all the roads of existence the pack
of appetites and instincts, this was the craving which the
manners of the time betrayed. It was "merry England,"
as they called it then. It was not yet stern and constrained.
It extended widely, freely, and rejoiced to find
itself so expanded. A few sectarians, chiefly in the
towns, clung gloomily to the Bible; but the Court, and
the men of the world sought their teachers and their
heroes from Pagan Greece and Rome. Nearer still was
another Paganism, that of Italy, and civilisation was
drawn thence as from a spring. Transplanted into different
races and climates, this paganism received from
each a distinct character&mdash;in England it becomes English.
Here Surrey&mdash;the English Petrarch&mdash;introduced a new
style, a manly style, which marks a great transformation
of the mind. He looks forward to the last line while
writing the first, and keeps the strongest word for the
last. He collects his phrases in harmonious periods, and
by his inversions adds force to his ideas. Every epithet
contains an idea, every metaphor a sentiment. Those
who have ideas now possess in the new-born art an instrument
capable of expressing them. In half a century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
English writers had introduced every artifice of language,
period, and style.</p>

<p>Luxuriance and irregularity were the two features of
the new literature. Sir Philip Sydney may be selected
as exhibiting the greatness and the folly of the prevailing
taste. How can his pastoral epic, "The Arcadia," be
described? It is but a recreation, a poetical romance
written in the country for the amusement of a sister, a
work of fashion, a relic, but it shows the best of the
general spirit, the jargon of the world of culture, fantastic
imagination, excessive sentiment, a medley of events
which suited men scarcely recovered from barbarism.
At his period men's heads were full of tragical images,
and Sydney's "Arcadia" contains enough of them to
supply half a dozen epics. And Sydney was only a soldier
in an army; there is a multitude about him, a multitude
of poets. How happens it that when this generation
was exhausted true poetry ended in England as true
painting in Italy and Flanders? It was because an epoch
of the mind came and passed away. These men had
new ideas and no theories in their heads. Their emotions
were not the same as ours. For them all things had a
soul, and though they had no more beauty then than
now, men found them more beautiful.</p>

<h4><i>Spenser</i></h4>

<p>Among all the poems of this time there is one truly
divine&mdash;Spenser's "FaÃ«rie Queene." Everything in his
life was calculated to lead Spenser to ideal poetry; but
the heart within is the true poet. Before all, his was a
soul captivated by sublime and chaste beauty. Philosophy
and landscapes, ceremonies and ornaments, splendours of
the country and the court, on all which he painted or
thought he impressed his inward nobleness. Spenser
remains calm in the fervour of invention. He is epic,
that is, a narrator. No modern is more like Homer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
Like Homer, he is always simple and clear; he makes
no leap, he omits no argument, he preserves the natural
sequence of ideas while presenting noble classical images.
Like Homer, again, he is redundant, ingenuous: even
childish. He says everything, and repeats without limit
his ornamental epithets.</p>

<p>To expand in epic faculties in the region where his
soul is naturally borne, he requires an ideal stage, situated
beyond the bounds of reality, in a world which
could never be. His most genuine sentiments are fairy-like.
Magic is the mould of his mind. He carries everything
that he looks upon into an enchanted land. Only
the world of chivalry could have furnished materials for
so elevated a fancy. It is the beauty in the poet's heart
which his whole works try to express, a noble yet laughing
beauty, English in sentiment, Italian in externals,
chivalric in subject, representing a unique epoch, the
appearance of Paganism in a Christian race, and the
worship of form by an imagination of the North.</p>

<p>Among the prose writers of the Pagan renaissance, two
may be singled out as characteristic, namely, Robert
Burton&mdash;an ecclesiastic and university recluse who dabbled
in all the sciences, was gifted with enthusiasm and
spasmodically gay, but as a rule sad and morose, and
according to circumstances a poet, an eccentric, a humorist,
a madman, or a Puritan&mdash;and Francis Bacon, the
most comprehensive, sensible, originative mind of the
age; a great and luminous intellect. After more than
two centuries it is still to Bacon that we go to discover
the theory of what we are attempting and doing.</p>

<h4><i>The Theatre</i></h4>

<p>The theatre was a special product of the English
Renaissance. If ever there was a living and natural
work, it is here. There were already seven theatres in
Shakespeare's time, so great and universal was the taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
for representations. The inborn instincts of the people
had not been tamed, nor muzzled, nor diminished. We
hear from the stage as from the history of the times,
the fierce murmur of all the passions. Not one of them
was lacking. The poets who established the drama, carried
in themselves the sentiments which the drama represents.
Greene, Marlowe, and the rest, were ill-regulated,
passionate, outrageously vehement and audacious. The
drama is found in Marlowe as the plant in the seed, and
Marlowe was a primitive man, the slave of his passions,
the sport of his dreams. Shakespeare, Beaumont,
Fletcher, Jonson, Webster, Massinger, Ford, appear
close upon each other, a new and favoured generation,
flourishing in the soil fertilised by the efforts of the
generation which preceded them. The characters they
produced were such as either excite terror by their violence,
or pity by their grace. Passion ravages all around
when their tragic figures are on the stage; and contrasted
with them is a troop of sweet and timid figures, tender
before everything, and the most loveworthy it has been
given to man to depict. The men are warlike, imperious,
unpolished; the women have sweetness, devotion,
patience, inextinguishable affection&mdash;a thing unknown in
distant lands, and in France especially. With these
women love becomes almost a holy thing. They aim not
at pleasure but at devotion. When a new civilisation
brings a new art to light there are about a dozen men
of talent who express the general idea surrounding one
or two men of genius who express it thoroughly. The
first constitute the chorus, the others the leaders. The
leaders in this movement are Shakespeare and Ben
Jonson.</p>

<p>Ben Jonson was a genuine Englishman, big and
coarsely framed, combative, proud, often morose, prone
to strain splenitic imaginations. His knowledge was vast.
In an age of great scholars he is one of the best classics
of his time. Other poets for the most part are visionaries;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
Jonson is all but a logician. Whatever he undertakes,
whatever be his faults, haughtiness, rough-handling,
predilection for morality and the past, he is never
little or commonplace. Nearly all his work consists of
comedies, not sentimental and fanciful as Shakespeare's,
but satirical, written to represent and correct follies and
vices. Even when he grew old his imagination remained
abundant and fresh. He is the brother of Shakespeare.</p>

<h4><i>Shakespeare</i></h4>

<p>Only this great age could have cradled such a child as
Shakespeare. What soul! What extent of action, and
what sovereignty of an unique faculty! What diverse
creations, and what persistence of the same impress!
Look now. Do you not see the poet behind the crowd
of his creations? They have all shown somewhat of
him. Ready, impetuous, impassioned, delicate, his genius
is pure imagination, touched more vividly and by slighter
things than ours. Hence, his style, blooming with exuberant
images, loaded with exaggerated metaphors. An
extraordinary species of mind, all-powerful, excessive,
equally master of the sublime and the base, the most
creative that ever engaged in the exact copy of the
details of actual existence, in the dazzling caprice of
fancy, in the profound complications of superhuman
passions; a nature inspired, superior to reason, extreme
in joy and pain, abrupt of gait, stormy and impetuous
in its transports!</p>

<p>Shakespeare images with copiousness and excess; he
spreads metaphors profusely over all he writes; it is a
series of painting which is unfolded in his mind, picture
on picture, image on image, he is forever copying the
strange and splendid visions which are heaped up within
him. Such an imagination must needs be vehement.
Every metaphor is a convulsion. Shakespeare's style is
a compound of curious impressions. He never sees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
things tranquilly. Like a fiery and powerful horse, he
bounds but cannot run. He flies, we creep. He is
obscure and original beyond all the poets of his or any
other age&mdash;the most immoderate of all violaters of language,
the most marvellous of all creators of souls. The
critic is lost in Shakespeare as in an immense town. He
can only describe a few monuments and entreat the
reader to imagine the city.</p>

<h4><i>The Christian Renaissance</i></h4>

<p>Following the pagan came the Christian Renaissance
born of the Reformation, a new birth in harmony with
the genius of the Germanic peoples. It must be admitted
that the Reformation entered England by a side door.
It was established when Henry VIII. permitted the English
Bible to be published. England had her book.
Hence have sprung much of the English language and
half of the English manners; to this day the country is
Biblical. After the Bible the book most widely-read in
England is the Pilgrim's Progress by John Bunyan.
It is a manual of devotion for the use of simple folk.
In it we hear a man of the people speaking to the people,
who would render intelligible to all the terrible doctrine
of damnation and salvation. Allegory is natural to Bunyan.
He employs it from necessity. He only grasps
truth when it is made simple by images. His work is
allegorical, that it may be intelligible. Bunyan is a poet
because he is a child. He has the freedom, the tone,
the ease, the clearness of Homer; he is as close to Homer
as an Anabaptist tinker could be to a heroic singer.
He and Milton survived as the two last poets of the
Reformation, oppressed and insulted, but their work continues
without noise, for the ideal they raised was, after
all, that which the time suggested and the race demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Milton</i></h4>

<p>John Milton was not one of those fevered souls whose
rapture takes them by fits, and whose inquietude condemns
them to paint the contradictions of passion. His
mind was lucid, his imagination limited. He does not
create souls but constructs arguments. Emotions and
arguments are arranged beneath a unique sentiment, that
of the sublime, and the broad river of lyric poetry
streams from him with even flow, splendid as a cloth
of gold.</p>

<p>Against external fluctuations he found a refuge in himself;
and the ideal city which he had built in his soul
endured impregnable to all assaults. He believed in the
sublime with the whole force of his nature, and the whole
authority of his logic. When after a generous education
he returned from his travels he threw himself into the
strife of the times heartily, armed with logic, indignation
and learning, and protected by conviction and conscience.
I have before me the formidable volume in which his
prose works were collected. What a book! The chairs
creak when you place it upon them. How we cannot fix
our attention on the same point for a page at a time.
We require manageable ideas; we have disused the big
two-handed sword of our forefathers. If Michael
Angelo's prophets could speak, it would be in Milton's
style. Overloaded with ornaments, infinitely prolonged,
these periods are triumphant choruses of angelic
Alleluias sung by deep voices to the accompaniment of
ten thousand harps of gold. But is he truly a prose-writer?
Entangled dialectics, a heavy and awkward mind,
fanatical and ferocious provincialism, the blast and
temerities of implacable passion, the sublimity of religious
and lyric exaltation&mdash;we do not recognize in these
features a man born to explain, persuade, and prove.</p>

<p>As a poet Milton wrote not by impulse but like a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
of letters with the assistance of books, seeing objects as
much through previous writings as in themselves, adding
to his images the images of others, borrowing and recasting
their inventions. He made thus for himself a composite
and brilliant style, less natural than that of his
precursors, less fit for effusions, less akin to the lively
first glow of sensation, but more solid, more regular,
more capable of concentrating in one large patch of light
all their sparklings and splendours. He compacted and
ennobled the poets' domain.</p>

<p>When, however, after seventeen years of fighting and
misfortune had steeped his soul in religious ideas, mythology
yielded to theology, the habit of discussion subdued
the lyric light. The poet no longer sings sublime
verse, he harangues in grave verse, he gives us correct
solemn discourses. Adam and Eve the first pair! I
listen and hear two reasoners of the period&mdash;Colonel
Hutchinson and his wife. Heavens! dress them at once.
Folks so cultivated should have invented before all a
pair of trousers and modesty. This Adam enters Paradise
via England. There he learnt respectability and
moral speechifying. Adam was your true <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pater familias</i>
with a vote, an old Oxford man, consulted at need by
his wife, and dealing out to her with prudent measure
the scientific explanations which she requires. The flow
of dissertations never pauses. From Paradise it gets into
Heaven. Milton's Jehovah is a grave king who maintains
a suitable state something like Charles I. The finest
thing in connection with Paradise is Hell; and in this
history of God, the chief part is taken by the devil. No
poetic creation equals in horror and grandeur the spectacle
that greeted Satan on leaving his dungeon.</p>

<p>But what a heaven! One would rather enter Charles I's
troops of lackeys, or Cromwell's Ironsides. What a gap
between this monarchical frippery and the visions of
Dante! To the poet of the Apocalypse the voice of the
deity was "as the sound of many waters; and he had in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
his right hand seven stars; and his countenance was as
the sun shining in his strength; and when I saw him I
fell at his feet as dead." When Milton arranged his
celestial show, he did not fall at his feet as dead.</p>

<p>When we take in, in one view, the vast literary region
of England, extending from the restoration of the Stuarts
to the French Revolution, we perceive that all the productions
bear a classical impress, such as is met with
neither in the preceding nor in the succeeding time. This
classical art finds its centre in the labours of Pope, and
above all in Pope, whose favourite author is Dryden, of
all English poets the least inspired and the most classical.
Pope gave himself up to versification. He did not write
because he thought, but he thought in order to write. I
wish I could admire his works of imagination, but I cannot.
I know the machinery. There is, however, a poet
in Pope, and to discover him we have only to read him
in fragments. Each verse in Pope is a masterpiece if
taken alone. There is a classical architecture of ideas,
and of all the masters who have practised it in England
Pope is the most skilled.</p>

<h4><i>The Modern Spirit</i></h4>

<p>The spirit of the modern revolution broke out first in
a Scotch peasant, Robert Burns. Scarcely ever was seen
together more of misery and talent. Burns cries out in
favour of instinct and joy. Love was his main business.
In him for the first time a poet spoke as men speak, or,
rather, as they think, without premeditation, with a mixture
of all styles. Burns was much in advance of his
age, and the life of men in advance of their age is not
wholesome. He died worn out at 37. In him old narrow
moralities give place to the wide sympathy of the modern
man.</p>

<p>Now appeared the English romantic school. Among
the multitude of its writers we may distinguish Southey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
a clever man, a producer of decorative poems to suit the
fashion; Coleridge, a poor fellow who had steeped himself
in mystical theories; Thomas More, a witty railer;
and Walter Scott, the favourite of his age, who was read
over the whole of Europe, was almost equal to Shakespeare,
had more popularity than Voltaire, earned about
Â£200,000, and taught us all history. Scott gave to Scotland
a citizenship of literature. Scott loves men from
the bottom of his heart. By his fundamental honesty and
wide humanity he was the Homer of modern life.</p>

<p>When the philosophical spirit passed from Germany
to England, transformed itself and became Anglican,
deformed itself and became revolutionary, it produced
a Wordsworth, a Byron, a Shelley. Wordsworth, a
new Cowper, with less talent and more ideas, was essentially
an interior man, engrossed by the concerns of the
soul. To such men life becomes a grave business on
which we must incessantly and scrupulously reflect.
Wordsworth was a wise and happy man, a thinker and
dreamer, who read and walked and listened in deep calm
to his own thoughts. The peace was so great within
him and around him that he could perceive the imperceptible.
He saw grandeur and beauty in the trivial events
which weave the woof of our most commonplace days.
His "Excursion" is like a Protestant temple&mdash;august
though bare and monstrous.</p>

<p>Shelley, one of the greatest poets of the age, beautiful
as an angel, of extraordinary precocity, sweet, generous,
tender, overflowing with gifts of heart, mind, birth, and
fortune, marred his life by introducing into his conduct
the enthusiastic imagination he should have kept for his
verse. His world is beyond our own. We move in it
between heaven and earth, in abstraction, dreamland,
symbolism. Shelley loved desert and solitary places,
where man enjoys the pleasure of believing infinite what
he sees&mdash;infinite as his soul. Verily there is a soul in
everything; in the universe is a soul; even beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
sensible form shines a secret essence and something
divine which we catch sight of by sublime illuminations,
never reaching or penetrating it. The poets hear the
great heart of nature beat; they would reach it. One
alone, Byron, succeeds.</p>

<p>I have reserved for the last the greatest and most English
artist, from whom we may learn more truths of his
country and of his age than from all the rest. All styles
appear dull, and all souls sluggish by the side of Byron's.
No such great poet has had so narrow an imagination.
They are his own sorrows, his own revolts, his own travels,
which, hardly transformed and modified, he introduces
into his verses. He never could make a poem save
of his own heart. If Goethe was the poet of the universe,
Byron was the poet of the individual; and if the
German genius found its interpretation in the one, the
English genius found its interpretation in the other.</p>

<h2 id="ch_312"><a name="HENRY_DAVID_THOREAU" id="HENRY_DAVID_THOREAU">HENRY DAVID THOREAU</a></h2>

<h3>"Walden"</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Henry David Thoreau, America's poet-naturalist, as he might
be called, was born at Concord, Mass., on July 12, 1817. His
great-grandparents were natives of the Channel Islands, whence
his grandfather emigrated. Thoreau was educated at Hartford,
and began work as a teacher, but under the influence of Emerson,
in whose house he lived at intervals, made writing his hobby
and a study of the outdoor world his occupation. In 1845, as related
in "Walden," he built himself a shanty near Walden Pond,
on land belonging to Emerson. There he busied himself with
writing his "Week on the Concord and Merrimac Rivers," and
in recording his observations in the woods. After the Walden
experiment he mingled the pursuit of literature and the doing
of odd jobs for a living. His books, "The Maine Woods," "A
Yankee in Canada," "Excursions in Field and Wood," were
mostly published after his death. He died on May 6, 1862, from
consumption. Emerson, Hawthorne, and Alcott were his warm
friends in life, and helped the world to appreciate his genius.
A poet in heart, Thoreau was only successful in giving his
poetry a prose setting, but that setting is harmonised with the
utmost delicacy. No one has produced more beautiful effects in
English prose with simpler words.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>The Simple Life</i></h4>

<p>When I wrote the following pages, I lived alone, in
the woods, a mile from any neighbour, in a house I had
built for myself, on the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord,
Massachusetts, and earned my living by the labour
of my hands only. I lived there two years and two
months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized life
again.</p>

<p>Men labour under a mistake. By a seeming fate,
commonly called necessity, they are employed laying up
treasures which moth and rust will corrupt. It is a fool's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
life, as they will find when they get to the end of it if
not before.</p>

<p>But it is never too late to give up our prejudices.
What old people say you cannot do, you try and find
that you can. I have lived some thirty years and I have
yet to hear the first syllable of valuable advice from my
seniors.</p>

<p>To many creatures, there is but one necessity of life&mdash;food.
None of the brute creation require more than
food and shelter. The necessaries of life for man in
this climate may be distributed under the several heads
of food, shelter, clothing, and fuel. I find by my own
experience a few implements, a knife, an axe, a spade, a
wheelbarrow, etc., and for the studious, lamplight, stationery,
and access to a few books, rank next to necessaries,
and can all be obtained at a trifling cost. Most
of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of
life, are positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.
None can be an impartial or wise observer of human life
but from the vantage ground of voluntary poverty.</p>

<h4><i>Ideals</i></h4>

<p>If I should attempt to tell how I have desired to spend
my life in years past it would probably astonish those
who know nothing about it.</p>

<p>I long ago lost a hound, a bay horse, and a turtle dove,
and am still on their trail. Many are the travellers I
have spoken, concerning them, describing their tracks
and what calls they answered to. I have met one or two
who had heard the hound, and the tramp of the horse,
and even seen the dove disappear behind a cloud, and
they seemed as anxious to recover them as if they had
lost them themselves.</p>

<p>How many mornings, summer and winter, before any
neighbour was stirring about his business, have I been
about mine! So many autumn, aye, and winter days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
spent outside the town trying to hear what was in the
wind, to hear and carry it. At other times waiting at
evening on the hill-tops for the sky to fall that I might
catch something, though I never caught much, and that,
manna-wise, would dissolve again in the sun.</p>

<p>For many years I was self-appointed inspector of
snow storms and rain storms, and did my duty faithfully;
surveyor, if not of highways, then of forest paths.
I looked after the wild stock of the town. I have
watered the red huckleberry, the sand cherry and the
nettle tree, the red pine and the black ash, the white
grape and the yellow violet, which might have withered
else in dry seasons.</p>

<p>My purpose in going to Walden Pond was not to live
cheaply nor to live dearly there, but to transact some
private business with the fewest obstacles.</p>

<h4><i>House Building</i></h4>

<p>When I consider my neighbours, the farmers of Concord,
I find that for the most part they have been toiling
twenty, thirty, or forty years, that they may become the
real owners of their farms; and we may regard one-third
of that toil as the cost of their houses. And when the
farmer has got his house he may not be the richer but
the poorer for it, and it be the house that has got him.
The very simplicity and nakedness of men's life in the
primitive ages imply that they left him still a sojourner
in nature. When he was refreshed with food and sleep
he contemplated his journey again. He dwelt as it were
in the tent of this world. We now no longer camp as
for a night, but have settled down on earth and forgotten
Heaven.</p>

<p>Near the end of March, 1845, I borrowed an axe and
went down to the woods by Walden Pond, nearest to
where I intended to build my house, and began to cut
down some tall, arrowy, white pines, still in their youth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
for timber. It was a pleasant hillside where I worked,
covered with pine woods, through which I looked out on
the pond, and a small open field in the woods where pines
and hickories were springing up. Before I had done I
was more the friend than the foe of the pine tree,
having become better acquainted with it.</p>

<p>By the middle of April my house was framed and
ready for raising. At length, in the beginning of May,
with the help of some of my acquaintances, rather to
improve so good an occasion for neighbourliness than
from any necessity, I set up the frame of my house. I
began to occupy it on the 4th of July, as soon as it was
boarded and roofed, for the boards were carefully
feather-edged and lapped, so that it was perfectly impervious
to rain, but before boarding I laid the foundation
of a chimney. I built the chimney after my hoeing
in the fall, before a fire became necessary for warmth,
doing my cooking in the meantime out of doors on the
ground, early in the morning. When it stormed before
my bread was baked I fixed a few boards over the fire,
and sat under them to watch my loaf, and passed some
pleasant hours in that way.</p>

<p>The exact cost of my house, not counting the work, all
of which was done by myself, was just over twenty-eight
dollars. I thus found that the student who wishes for a
shelter can obtain one for a lifetime at an expense not
greater than the rent which he now pays annually.</p>

<h4><i>Farming</i></h4>

<p>Before I finished my house, wishing to earn ten or
twelve dollars by some honest and agreeable method, in
order to meet my unusual expenses, I planted about two
acres and a half of light and sandy soil near it, chiefly
with beans, but also a small part with potatoes, corn,
peas, and turnips. I was obliged to hire a team and a
man for the ploughing, though I held the plough myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
My farm outgoes for the first season were, for employment,
seed, work, etc., 14 dollars 72Â½ cents. I got twelve
bushels of beans and eighteen bushels of potatoes, besides
some peas and sweet corn. My whole income from
the farm was 23 dollars 43 cents, a profit of 8 dollars
71Â½ cents, besides produce consumed.</p>

<p>The next year I did better still, for I spaded up all the
land that I required, about a third of an acre, and I
learned from the experience of both years, not being in
the least awed by many celebrated works on husbandry,
that if one would live simply and eat only the crop which
he raised, he would need to cultivate only a few rods of
ground, and that it would be cheaper to spade up that
than to use oxen to plough it, and he could do all his
necessary farm work, as it were, with his left hand at
odd hours in the summer.</p>

<p>My food for nearly two years was rye and Indian
meal without yeast, potatoes, rice, a very little salt pork,
molasses and salt, and my drink water. I learned from
my two years' experience that it would cost incredibly
little trouble to obtain one's necessary food even in this
latitude, and that a man may use as simple a diet as the
animals and yet retain health and strength.</p>

<p>Bread I at first made of pure Indian meal and salt,
genuine hoe-cakes, which I baked before my fire out of
doors, but at last I found a mixture of rye and Indian
meal most convenient and agreeable. I made a study of
the ancient and indispensable art of bread-making, going
back to the primitive days. Leaven, which some
deem to be the soul of bread, I discovered was not indispensable.</p>

<p>Thus I found I could avoid all trade and barter, so
far as my food was concerned, and having a shelter
already, it would only remain to get clothing and fuel.
My furniture, part of which I made myself, consisted of
a bed, a table, a desk, three chairs, a looking-glass, three
inches in diameter, a pair of tongs and andirons, a kettle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
a skillet, and a frying pan, a dipper, a wash bowl, two
knives and forks, three plates, one cup, one spoon, a jug
for oil, a jug for molasses, and a japanned lamp. When
I have met an immigrant tottering under a bundle which
contained his all, I have pitied him, not because it was
his all, but because he had all that to carry.</p>

<h4><i>Earning a Living</i></h4>

<p>For more than five years I maintained myself solely
by the labour of my hands, and I found that by working
for about six weeks in the year I could meet all the expenses
of living. The whole of my winters, as well as
most of my summers, I had free and clear for study.
I have thoroughly tried school-keeping, and found that
my expenses were out of proportion to my income, for I
was obliged to dress and train, not to say think and believe
accordingly; and I lost my time into the bargain.
I have tried trade; but I have learned that trade curses
everything it handles; and though you trade in messages
from Heaven, the whole curse of trade attaches to the
business. I found that the occupation of day-labourer
was the most independent of any, especially as it required
only thirty or forty days in the year to support me. The
labourer's day ends with the going down of the sun,
and he is then free to devote himself to his chosen pursuit,
independent of his labour; but his employer, who
speculates from month to month, has no respite from one
end of the year to the other.</p>

<p>But all this is very selfish, I have heard some of my
townsmen say. I confess that I have hitherto indulged
very little in philanthropic enterprises. However, when
I thought to indulge myself in this respect by maintaining
certain poor persons as comfortably as I maintain
myself, and even ventured so far as to make them the
offer, they one and all unhesitatingly preferred to remain
poor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span></p>

<h4><i>The Life with Nature</i></h4>

<p>When I took up my abode in the woods I found myself
suddenly neighbour to the birds, not by having imprisoned
one, but having caged myself near them. I was
not only nearer to some of those which commonly frequent
the garden and orchard, but to those wilder and
more thrilling songsters of the forest which never, or
rarely, serenade a villager.</p>

<p>Every morning was a cheerful invitation to make my
life of equal simplicity, and I may say, innocence, with
Nature herself. I have been as sincere a worshipper of
Aurora as the Greeks. Morning brings back the heroic
ages. Then, for an hour at least, some part of us awakes
which slumbers all the rest of the day and night.</p>

<p>Why should we live with such hurry and waste of life?
As for work, we haven't any of any consequence. We
have the Saint Vitus' dance, and cannot possibly keep
our heads still. Hardly a man takes a half hour's nap
after dinner, but when he wakes he holds up his head
and asks: "What's the news?" as if the rest of mankind
had stood his sentinels. "Pray tell me anything
new that has happened to a man anywhere on this globe."
And he reads over his coffee and rolls that a man has
had his eyes gouged out this morning on the Wachito
River, never dreaming the while that he lives in the
dark, unfathomed mammoth cave of this world, and has
but the rudiment of an eye himself.</p>

<p>Let us spend our day as deliberately as Nature. Let
us rise early and fast, or break fast, gently and without
perturbation. Let us not be upset and overwhelmed in
that terrible rapid and whirlpool called a dinner situated
in the meridian shadows.</p>

<p>Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in. I drink at it,
but while I drink I see the sandy bottom, and detect how
shallow it is. Its thin current glides away, but eternity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
remains. I would drink deeper, fish in the sky, whose
bottom is pebbly with stars.</p>

<h4><i>Reading</i></h4>

<p>My residence was more favourable, not only to thought
but to serious reading, than a university; and though I
was beyond the range of the morning circulating library
I had more than ever come within the influence of those
books which circulate round the world. I kept Homer's
"Iliad" on my table through the summer, though I looked
at his pages only now and then. To read well&mdash;that is
to read true books in a true spirit&mdash;is a noble exercise
and one that will task the reader more than any exercise
which the customs of the day esteem. Books must be
read as deliberately and reservedly as they were written.
No wonder that Alexander carried the "Iliad" with
him on his expeditions in a precious casket. A written
word is the choicest of relics.</p>

<h4><i>In the Sun</i></h4>

<p>I did not read books the first summer; I hoed beans.
Nay, I often did better than this. There were times
when I could not afford to sacrifice the bloom of the
present moment to any work, whether of the head or
hands. I love a broad margin to my life. Sometimes
on a summer morning, having taken my accustomed
bath, I sat in my sunny doorway from sunrise till noon,
rapt in a reverie, amidst the pines and hickories and
sumachs in undisturbed solitude and stillness, while the
birds sang around or flitted noiseless through the house,
until by the sun falling in at my west window, or the
noise of some traveller's waggon on the distant highway,
I was reminded of the lapse of time. I grew in those
seasons like corn in the night, and they were far better
than any work of the hands would have been. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
were not time subtracted from my life, but so much over
and above my usual allowance. I realised what the
Orientals mean by contemplation and the forsaking of
works. Instead of singing like the birds I silently
smiled at my incessant good fortune. This was sheer
idleness to my fellow townsmen, no doubt, but if the
birds and flowers had tried me by their standard I should
not have been found wanting.</p>

<h4><i>Night Sounds</i></h4>

<p>Regularly at half past seven, in one part of the summer,
the whip-poor-wills chanted their vespers for half
an hour, sitting on a stump by my door, or upon the
ridge pole of the house. When other birds were still the
screech owls took up the strain, like mourning women
their ancient u-lu-lu. Wise midnight hags! I love to
hear their wailing, their doleful responses, trilled along
the woodside. They give me a new sense of the variety
and capacity of that nature which is our common dwelling.
<em>Oh-o-o-o-o that I had never been bor-r-r-r-n</em>! sighs
one on this side of the pond, and circles, with the restlessness
of despair to some new perch on the gray oaks.
Then: <em>That I had never been bor-r-r-r-n</em>! echoes another
on the further side with tremulous sincerity, and
<em>bor-r-r-r-n</em>! comes faintly from far in the Lincoln woods.
I require that there are owls. They represent the stark
twilight and unsatisfied thoughts which all have.</p>

<p>I am not sure that ever I heard the sound of cock
crowing from my clearing, and I thought that it might
be worth the while to keep a cockerel for his music
merely, as a singing bird. The note of this once wild
Indian pheasant is certainly the most remarkable of any
bird's, and if they could be naturalised without being
domesticated it would soon become the most famous
sound in our woods.</p>

<p>I kept neither dog, cat, cow, pig, nor hens, so that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
would have said there was a deficiency of domestic
sounds, neither the churn nor the spinning wheel, nor
even the singing of the kettle, nor the hissing of the urn,
nor children crying, to comfort me; only squirrels on the
roof, a whip-poor-will on the ridge pole, a bluejay
screaming beneath the window, a woodchuck under the
house, a laughing loon on the pond, and a fox to bark in
the night.</p>

<p>This is a delicious evening, when the whole body is
one sense and imbibes delight through every pore. I go
and come with a strange liberty in Nature, a part of
herself. Sympathy with the fluttering alder and poplar
leaves almost takes away my breath; yet, like the lake,
my serenity is rippled, but not ruffled. Though it is now
dark the wind still blows and roars in the woods, the
waves still dash, and some creatures lull the rest with
their notes. The repose is never complete. The wildest
animals do not repose but seek their prey now. They are
Nature's watchmen&mdash;links which connect the days of
animated life.</p>

<p>I find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the
time. I never found the companion that was never so
companionable as solitude. A man thinking or working
is always alone, let him be where he will. I am no more
lonely than the loon in the pond that laughs so loud. God
is alone, but the devil, he is far from being alone; he
sees a great deal of company; he is legion. I am no
more lonely than a single dandelion in a pasture, or a
humble bee, or the North Star, or the first spider in a
new house.</p>

<h4><i>Visitors</i></h4>

<p>In my house I have three chairs: one for solitude, two
for friendship, three for society. My best room, however&mdash;my
withdrawing room&mdash;always ready for company,
was the pine wood behind my house. Thither in
Summer days, when distinguished guests came, I took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
them, and a priceless domestic swept the floor and kept
the things in order.</p>

<p>I could not but notice some of the peculiarities of my
visitors. Girls and boys, and young women generally,
seemed glad to be in the woods. They looked in the
pond and at the flowers, and improved their time. Men
of business, even farmers, thought only of solitude and
employment, and of the great distance at which I dwelt
from something or other; and though they said that they
loved a ramble in the woods occasionally, it was obvious
that they did not. Restless, committed men, whose time
was all taken up in getting a living, or keeping it, ministers,
who spoke of God as if they enjoyed a monopoly
of the subject, and who could not bear all kinds of
opinions, doctors, lawyers, and uneasy housekeepers, who
pried into my cupboard and bed when I was out, young
men who had ceased to be young, and had concluded
that it was safest to follow the beaten track of the professions&mdash;all
these generally said that it was not possible
to do as much good in my position.</p>

<h4><i>Interference</i></h4>

<p>After hoeing, or perhaps reading and writing in the
forenoon, I usually bathed again in the pond, washed the
dust of labour from my person, and for the afternoon
was absolutely free. Every day or two I strolled to the
village. As I walked in the woods to see the birds and
the squirrels, so I walked in the village to see the men
and the boys. Instead of the wind among the pines I
heard the carts rattle.</p>

<p>One afternoon near the end of the first summer, when
I went to the village to get a shoe from the cobbler's, I
was seized and put into jail, because I did not pay a tax
to, or recognise the authority of, the State. I had gone
down to the woods for other purposes. But wherever
a man goes men will pursue and paw him with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
dirty institutions, and, if they can, constrain him to belong
to their desperate Odd Fellows society. However,
I was released the next day, obtained my mended shoe,
and returned to the woods in season to get my dinner of
huckleberries on Fair Haven Hill. I was never molested
by any person but those who represented the State. I
had no lock nor bolt but for the desk which held my
papers, not even a nail to put over my latch or window.
I never fastened my door night or day, and though I was
absent several days my house was more respected than
if it had been surrounded by a file of soldiers.</p>

<h4><i>Exhausted Experience</i></h4>

<p>I left the woods for as good a reason as I went there.
Perhaps it seemed to me that I had several more lives
to live and could not spare any more time for that one.
It is remarkable how easily and insensibly we fall into
a particular route, and make a beaten track for ourselves.
I had not lived there a week before my feet wore
a path from my door to the pond side, and though it is
five or six years since I trod it, it is still quite distinct.
So with the paths which the mind travels. How worn
and dusty then must be the highways of the world&mdash;how
deep the ruts of tradition and conformity. I learned
this, at least by my experiment, that if one advances confidently
in the direction of his dreams, and endeavours to
live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a
success unexpected in common hours. In proportion as
he simplifies his life the laws of the Universe will appear
less complex, and solitude will not be solitude, nor poverty
poverty, nor weakness weakness.</p>

<h3>Democracy in America</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Alexis de Tocqueville (see Vol. XII, p. 117), being commissioned
at the age of twenty-six to investigate and report
on American prisons, made use of his residence in the United
States to gain a thorough insight into the political institutions
and social conditions of the great Republic. The results
of his observations and reflections were given to the world
in 1835, in the two famous volumes <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">De la DÃ©mocratie en
AmÃ©rique</i>, which were followed in 1840 by a third and fourth
volume under the same title. As an analysis of American
political institutions De Tocqueville's work has been superseded
by Mr. Bryce's admirable study of the same subject; but as
one of the great classics of political philosophy it can never
be superseded, and has rarely been rivalled. With all a Frenchman's
simplicity and lucidity he traces the manifold results of
the democratic spirit; though sometimes an excessive ingenuity,
which is also French, leads him to over-speculative conclusions.
The work was received with universal applause.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>I.&mdash;Equality</i></h4>

<p>The most striking impression which I received during
my residence in the United States was that of the equality
which reigns there. This equality gives a peculiar character
to public opinion and to the laws of that country,
and influences the entire structure of society in the most
profound degree. Realising that equality, or democracy,
was rapidly advancing in the Old World also, I determined
to make a thorough study of democratic principles
and of their consequences, as they are revealed in the
western continent.</p>

<p>We have only to review the history of European countries
from the days of feudalism, to understand that the
development of equality is one of the great designs of
Providence; inasmuch as it is universal, inevitable, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
lasting, and that every event and every individual contributes
to its advancement.</p>

<p>It is impossible to believe that a social movement which
has proceeded so far as this movement towards equality
has done, can be arrested by human efforts, or that the
democracy which has bearded kings and barons can be
successfully resisted by a wealthy bourgeoisie. We know
not whither we are moving; we only know that greater
equality is found to-day among Christian populations
than has been known before in any age or in any country.</p>

<p>I confess to a kind of religious terror in the presence
of this irresistible revolution, which has defied every
obstacle for the last ten centuries. A new political science
is awaited by a world which is wholly new; but the most
immediate duties of the statesman are to instruct the
democracy, if possible to revive its beliefs, to purify its
morals, to enlighten its inexperience by some knowledge
of political principles, and to substitute for the blind
instincts which sway it, the consciousness of its true
interests.</p>

<p>In the Old World, and in France especially, the more
powerful, intelligent, and moralised classes have held
themselves apart from democracy, and the latter has,
therefore, been abandoned to its own savage instincts.
The democratic revolution has permeated the whole
substance of society, without those concomitant changes
in laws, ideas, habits, and manners which ought to have
embodied and clothed it. So it is that we indeed have
democracy, but without those features which should
have mitigated its vices and liberated its advantages.
The prestige of royal power is gone, without being replaced
by the majesty of law, and our people despise
authority as much as they fear it. Our poor have the
prejudices of their fathers without their beliefs, their
ignorance, without their virtues; they have taken self-interest
for a principle without knowing what their interests
are. Our society is tranquil, not in the consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
of strength and of well-being, but a sense of
decrepitude and despair. That is why I have studied
America, in order that we may ourselves profit by her
example. I have no intention of writing a panegyric on
the United States. I have seen more in America than
America herself; I have sought a revelation of Democracy,
with all its characters and tendencies, its prejudices
and its passions.</p>

<h4><i>II.&mdash;Religion and Liberty</i></h4>

<p>Our first consideration is of great importance, and
must never be lost sight of. The Anglo-American civilisation
which we find in the United States is the product
of two perfectly distinct elements, which elsewhere are
often at war with one another, but have here been
merged and combined in the most wonderful way; I
mean the spirit of religion and the spirit of liberty. The
founders of New England were at the same time ardent
secretaries and enthusiastic radicals; they were bound
by the narrowest religious beliefs, but were free from
all political prejudice.</p>

<p>Thus arose two tendencies which we may trace everywhere
in American manners, as well as in their lives.
All political principles, laws, and human institutions
seem to have become plastic in the hands of the early
colonists. The bonds which fettered the society in which
they had been born fell from their limbs; ancient opinions
which had dominated the world for ages simply disappeared;
a new career opened for the human race; a
world without horizons was before them, and they exulted
in liberty. But outside the limits of the political
world, they made no ventures of this kind. They abjured
doubt, renounced their desire for innovation, left untouched
the veil of the sanctuary, and knelt with awe
before the truths of religion.</p>

<p>So, in their world of morals, everything was already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
classed, arranged, foreseen, and determined; but in their
world of politics, everything was agitated, debated, and
uncertain. In the former they were ruled by a voluntary
obedience, but in all political affairs they were inspired
by independence, contempt for experience, and jealous
of every authority.</p>

<p>Far from impeding one another, these two tendencies,
which appear so radically opposed, actually harmonise
and seem even to support each other. Religion sees in
civil liberty a noble field for the exercise of human
faculties. Free and powerful in her own sphere, and
satisfied with the part reserved for her, she knows that
her sovereignty is all the more securely established when
she depends only on her own strength and is founded in
the hearts of men. And liberty, on the other hand,
recognises in religion the comrade of its struggles and
triumphs, the cradle of its rights. It knows that religion
is the safeguard of morals, and that morals are the safeguard
of the laws, and the judge of the continuance of
liberty itself.</p>

<h4><i>III.&mdash;Omnipotence of the Majority</i></h4>

<p>The greatest danger to liberty in America lies in the
omnipotence of the majority. A democratic power is
never likely to perish for lack of strength or of resources,
but it may very well fall because of the misdirection of
its strength and the abuse of its resources. If ever liberty
is lost in America, it will be due to an oppression of
minorities which may drive them to an appeal to arms.
The anarchy which must then result will be due only to
despotism.</p>

<p>This danger has not escaped the notice of American
statesmen. Thus, President James Madison said, "It
is of great importance to republics, not only that society
should be defended from the oppression of those who
govern it, but also that one section of society should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
protected against the injustice of another section; for
justice is the end towards which all government must be
directed." Again, Jefferson said that "The tyranny of
legislators is at present, and will be for many years, our
most formidable danger. The tyranny of the executive
will arise in its turn, but at a more distant period."
Jefferson's words are of great importance, for I consider
him to have been the most powerful apostle that
democracy has ever had.</p>

<p>But there are certain factors in the United States
which moderate this tyranny of the majority. Chief
among these is the absence of any administrative centralisation;
so that the majority, which has often the tastes
and instincts of a despot, lacks the instruments and the
means of tyranny. The local administrative bodies constitute
so many reefs and breakwaters to retard or divide
the stream of the popular will.</p>

<p>Not less important, as a counterpoise to the danger
of democracy, is the strong legal spirit which pervades
the United States. Lawyers have great influence and
authority in matters of government. But lawyers are
strongly imbued with the tasks and habits of mind which
are most characteristic of aristocracy; they have an instinctive
liking for forms and for order, a native distaste
for the will of the multitude, and a secret contempt for
popular government. Of course, their own personal
interest may and often does over-ride this professional
bias. But lawyers will always be, on the whole, friends
of order and of precedent, and enemies of change. And
in America, where there are neither nobles nor able
political writers, and where the people are suspicious of
the wealthy, the lawyers do, in fact, form the most powerful
order in politics, and the most intellectual class of
society. They therefore stand to lose by any innovation,
and their conservative tendency is reinforced by their
interests as a class.</p>

<p>A third safeguard against the tyranny of the majority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
is to be found in the institution of a jury. Almost
everyone is called at one time or another to sit on a jury,
and thus learns at least something of the judicial spirit.
The civil jury has saved English freedom in past times,
and may be expected to maintain American liberties also.
It is true that there are many cases, and those often the
most important, in which the American judge pronounces
sentence without a jury. Under those circumstances, his
position is similar to that of a French judge, but his
moral power is far greater; for the memory and the
influence of juries are all about him, and he speaks with
the authority of one who habitually rests upon the jury
system. In no other countries are the judges so powerful
as in those where the people are called in to share
judicial privileges and responsibilities.</p>

<h4><i>IV.&mdash;Equality of Men and Women</i></h4>

<p>Inasmuch as democracy destroys or modifies the various
inequalities which social traditions have made, it is
natural to ask whether it has had any effect on that great
inequality between men and women which is elsewhere
so conspicuous. We are driven to the conclusion that
the social movement which places son and father, servant
and master, and in general, the inferior and superior,
more nearly on the same level, must raise woman more
and more to an equality with man.</p>

<p>Let us guard, however, against misconceptions. There
are people in Europe who confuse the natural qualities
of the two sexes, and desire that men and women should
be, not only equal, but also similar to one another.
That would give them both the same functions, the same
duties and the same rights, and would have them mingle
in everything, in work, in pleasures, and in business.
But the attempt to secure this kind of equality between
the two sexes, only degrades them both, and must result
in unmanly men, and unwomanly women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
The Americans have not thus mistaken the kind of
democratic equality which ought to hold between man
and woman. They know that progress does not consist
in forcing these dissimilar temperaments and faculties
into the same mould, but in securing that each shall
fulfil his or her task in the best possible way. They
have most carefully separated the functions of man and
woman, in order that the great work of social life may be
most prosperously carried on.</p>

<p>In America, far more than elsewhere, the lines of
action of the two sexes have been clearly divided. You
do not find American women directing the external
affairs of the family, or entering into business or into
politics; but neither do you find them obliged to undertake
the rough labours of the field, or any other work
requiring physical strength. There are no families so
poor as to form an exception to this rule.</p>

<p>So it is that American women often unite a masculine
intelligence and a virile energy with an appearance of
great refinement and altogether womanly manners.</p>

<p>One has often noticed in Europe a certain tinge of contempt
even in the flatteries which men lavish on women;
and although the European often makes himself a slave
of a woman, it is easy to see that he never really regards
her as his equal. But in the United States men rarely
praise women, though they show their esteem for them
every day.</p>

<p>Americans show, in fact, a full confidence in woman's
reason, and a profound respect for her liberty. They
realise that her mind is just as capable as that of man to
discover truth, and that her heart is just as courageous
in following it; and they have never tried to shelter or
to guide her by means of prejudice, ignorance, or fear.</p>

<p>For my part I do not hesitate to say that the singular
prosperity and the evergrowing power of the American
people is due to the superiority of American women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span></p>

<h4><i>V.&mdash;The Perfectibility of Man</i></h4>

<p>Equality suggests many ideas which would never have
arisen without it, and among others the notion that humanity
can reach perfection&mdash;a theory which has
practical consequences of great interest.</p>

<p>In countries where the population is classed according
to rank, profession, and birth, and everyone has to follow
the career to which he happens to be born, each is conscious
of limits to his power, and does not attempt to
struggle against an inevitable destiny. Aristocratic
peoples do not deny that man may be improved, but they
think of this as an amelioration of the individual, and not
as a change in social circumstances, and while they admit
that humanity has made great progress, they believe in
certain limits which it cannot pass. They do not think,
for instance, that we shall arrive at sovereign good or at
absolute truth.</p>

<p>But in proportion as caste and class-distinction disappear,
the vision of an ideal perfection arises before the
human mind. Continual changes are ever taking place,
some of them to his disadvantage, but the majority to his
advantage, and the democrat concludes that man in general
is capable of arriving at perfection. His reverses
teach him that no one has yet discovered absolute good,
and his frequent successes excite him to pursue it. Always
seeking, falling, and rising again, often deceived,
but never discouraged, he hastens towards an immense
grandeur which he dimly conceives as the goal of humanity.
This theory of perfectibility exercises prodigious
influence even on those who have never thought of it.
For instance, I ask an American sailor why the ships of
his country are built to last only a few years; and he tells
me without hesitation that the art of shipbuilding makes
such rapid progress every day, that the finest ship constructed
to-day must be useless after a very short time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
From these words, spoken at random by an uneducated
man, I can perceive the general and systematic idea
which guides this great people in every matter.</p>

<h4><i>VI.&mdash;American Vanity</i></h4>

<p>All free people are proud of themselves, but national
pride takes different forms. The Americans, in their relations
with strangers, are impatient of the least criticism,
and absolutely insatiable for praise. The slightest
congratulation pleases them, but the most extravagant
eulogium is not enough to satisfy them; they are all the
time touting for your praise, and if you are slow to give
it they begin praising themselves. It is as if they were
doubtful of their own merit. Their vanity is not only
hungry, but anxious and envious. It gives nothing, and
asks insistently. It is both supplicant and pugnacious.
If I tell an American that his country is a fine one, he
replies, "It is the finest in the world." If I admire the
liberty which it enjoys, he answers, "There are few
people worthy of such liberty." I remark on the purity
of manners in the United States, and he says, "Yes, a
stranger who knows the corruption of other nations
must indeed be astonished at us." At length I leave him
to the contemplation of his country and of himself, but
he presently runs after me, and will not go away until I
have repeated it all over again. It is a kind of patriotism
that worries even those who honour it.</p>

<p>The Englishman, on the contrary, tranquilly enjoys
the real or imaginary advantages which his country
affords. He cares nothing for the blame nor for the
praise of strangers. His attitude towards the whole
world is one of disdainful and ignorant reserve. His
pride seeks no nourishment; it lives on itself. It is very
remarkable that the two people who have arisen from
the same stock should differ so radically in their way
of feeling and speaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
In aristocratic countries, great families possess enormous
privileges, on which their pride rests. They
consider these privileges as a natural right inherent in
their person, and their feeling of superiority is therefore
a peaceful one. They have no reason to boast of the prerogatives
which everyone concedes to them without question.
So, when public affairs are directed by an aristocracy,
the national pride tends to take this reserved,
haughty, and independent form.</p>

<p>Under democratic conditions, on the contrary, the
least advantage which anyone gains has great importance
in his eyes; for everyone is surrounded by millions very
nearly his equal. His pride therefore becomes anxious
and insatiable; he founds it on miserable trifles and
defends it obstinately. Again, most Americans have
recently acquired the advantages which they possess,
and therefore have inordinate pleasure in contemplating
these advantages, and in showing them to others; and as
these advantages may escape at any moment, they are
always uneasy about them, and look at them again and
again to see that they still have them. Men who live in
democracies love their country as they love themselves,
and model their national vanity upon their private vanity.
The close dependence of this anxious and insatiable
vanity of democratic peoples upon the equality and fragility
of their conditions is seen from the fact that the
members of the proudest nobility show exactly the same
passionate jealousy for the most trifling circumstances
of their life when these become unstable or are contested.</p>

<h3>The Compleat Angler</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Izaak Walton, English author and angler, was born at Stafford
on August 9, 1593, and until about his fiftieth year lived as a
linen-draper in London. He then retired from business and
lived at Stafford for a few years; but returned to London in
1650, and spent his closing years at Winchester, where he died
on December 15, 1683, and was buried in the cathedral there.
Walton was thrice married, his second wife being sister of the
future Bishop Ken. He had a large acquaintance with eminent
clergymen, and among his literary friends were Ben Jonson and
Michael Drayton. He was author of several charming biographies,
including those of the poet Donne, 1640, of Sir Henry
Wotton, 1651, of Richard Hooker, 1652, and of George Herbert,
1670. But by far his most famous work is "The Compleat
Angler; or, the Contemplative Man's Recreation," published in
1653. There were earlier books on the subject in English, such
as Dame Juliana Berner's "Treatise pertaining to Hawking,
Hunting, and Fishing with an Angle," 1486; the "Book of
Fishing with Hook and Line," 1590; a poem, "The Secrets of
Angling," by John Denny, 1613; and several others. The new
thing in Walton's book, and the secret of its unfading popularity,
is the charm of temperament. Charles Lamb well said that it
"breathes the very spirit of innocence, purity, and simplicity of
heart." A sequel to the book, entitled the "Second Part of the
Compleat Angler," was written by Charles Cotton, and published
in 1676.</p></blockquote>

<h4><i>The Virtues of Angling</i></h4>

<h5>PISCATOR, VENATOR, AND AUCEPS</h5>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> You are well overtaken, gentlemen! A
good morning to you both! I have stretched my legs
up Tottenham Hill to overtake you, hoping your business
may occasion you towards Ware, whither I am going
this fine fresh May morning.</p>

<p><i>Venator.</i> Sir, I, for my part, shall almost answer your
hopes, for my purpose is to drink my morning's draught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
at the Thatched House. And, sir, as we are all so happy
to have a fine morning, I hope we shall each be the happier
in each other's company.</p>

<p><i>Auceps.</i> Sir, I shall, by your favour, bear you company
as far as Theobald's, for then I turn up to a friend's
house, who mews a hawk for me. And as the Italians
say, good company in a journey maketh the way to seem
the shorter, I, for my part, promise you that I shall be
as free and open-hearted as discretion will allow with
strangers.</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> I am right glad to hear your answers. I
shall put on a boldness to ask you, sir, whether business
or pleasure caused you to be up so early, for this other
gentleman hath declared he is going to see a hawk that a
friend mews for him.</p>

<p><i>Venator.</i> Sir, I intend to go hunting the otter.</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> Those villainous vermin, for I hate them
perfectly, because they love fish so well, or rather destroy
so much. For I, sir, am a brother of the angle.</p>

<p><i>Auceps.</i> And I profess myself a falconer, and have
heard many grave, serious men scoff at anglers and pity
them, as it is a heavy, contemptible, dull recreation.</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> You know, gentlemen, it is an easy thing
to scoff at any art or recreation; a little wit mixed with
all nature, confidence, and malice will do it; but though
they often venture boldly, yet they are often caught, even
in their own trap.</p>

<p>There be many men that are by others taken to be
serious, and grave men, which we contemn and pity: men
that are taken to be grave because nature hath made
them of a sour complexion&mdash;money-getting men, men
that are condemned to be rich; for these poor, rich men,
we anglers pity them most perfectly. No, sir! We
enjoy a contentedness above the reach of such dispositions.</p>

<p><i>Venator.</i> Sir, you have almost amazed me; for
though I am no scoffer, yet I have&mdash;I pray let me speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
it without offence&mdash;always looked upon anglers as more
patient and simple men than, I fear, I shall find you to
be.</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> Sir, I hope you will not judge my earnestness
to be impatience! As for my simplicity, if by that
you mean a harmlessness which was usually found in
the primitive Christians, who were, as most anglers are,
followers of peace&mdash;then myself and men of my profession
will be glad to be so understood. But if, by simplicity,
you mean to express a general defect, I hope in
time to disabuse you.</p>

<p>But, gentlemen, I am not so unmannerly as to engross
all the discourse to myself; I shall be most glad to hear
what you can say in the commendation of your several
recreations.</p>

<p><i>Auceps.</i> The element I use to trade in, the air, is an
element of more worth than weight; an element that
doubtless exceeds both the earth and water; in it my
noble falcon ascends to such a height as the dull eye of
man is not able to reach to; my troop of hawks soars
up on high, so that they converse with the gods.</p>

<p>And more, the worth of this element of air is such
that all creatures whatsoever stand in need of it. The
waters cannot preserve their fish without air; witness
the not breaking of ice and the result thereof.</p>

<p><i>Venator.</i> Well, sir, I will now take my turn. The
earth, that solid, settled element, is the one on which I
drive my pleasant, wholesome, hungry trade. What pleasure
doth man take in hunting the stately stag, the cunning
otter! The earth breeds and nourishes the mighty elephant,
and also the least of creatures! It puts limits to
the proud and raging seas, and so preserves both man
and beast; daily we see those that are shipwrecked and
left to feed haddocks; but, Mr. Piscator, I will not be so
uncivil as not to allow you time for the commendation
of angling; I doubt we shall hear a watery discourse&mdash;and
I hope not a long one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
<i>Piscator.</i> Gentlemen, my discourse is likely to prove
suitable to my recreation&mdash;calm and quiet.</p>

<p>Water is the eldest daughter of the creation, the element
upon which the spirit of God did first move. There
be those that profess to believe that all bodies are water,
and may be reduced back into water only.</p>

<p>The water is more productive than the earth. The
increase of creatures that are bred in the water is not
only more miraculous, but more advantageous to man for
the preventing of sickness. It is observed that the casting
of Lent and other fish days hath doubtless been the
cause of these many putrid, shaking agues, to which this
country of ours is now more subject.</p>

<p>To pass by the miraculous cures of our known baths
the Romans have made fish the mistress of all their
entertainments; and have had music to usher in their
sturgeons, lampreys, and mullets.</p>

<p><i>Auceps.</i> Sir, it is with such sadness that I must part
with you here, for I see Theobald's house. And so I
part full of good thoughts. God keep you both.</p>

<p><i>Venator.</i> Sir, you said angling was of great antiquity,
and a perfect art, not easily attained to. I am
desirous to hear further concerning those particulars.</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> Is it not an art to deceive a trout with an
artificial fly? A trout! more sharp-sighted than any
hawk! Doubt not, angling is an art worth your learning.
The question is rather, whether you be capable of learning
it? Angling is like poetry&mdash;men are to be born
so. Some say it is as ancient as Deucalion's flood, and
Moses makes mention of fish-hooks, which must imply
anglers.</p>

<p>But as I would rather prove myself a gentleman by
being learned, and humble, valiant, and inoffensive, virtuous,
and communicable, than by any fond ostentation
of riches, or, wanting those virtues, boast these were in
my ancestors, so if this antiquity of angling shall be an
honour to this art, I shall be glad I made mention of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
I shall tell you that in ancient times a debate hath
arisen, whether the happiness of man doth consist more
in contemplation or action?</p>

<p>Some have endeavoured to maintain their opinion of
the first by saying that the nearer we mortals approach
to God by way of imitation, the more happy we are.
And they say God enjoys Himself only by a contemplation
of His own infiniteness, eternity, power, goodness
and the like.</p>

<p>On the contrary, there want not men of equal authority
that prefer action to be the more excellent, such as
experiments in physics for the ease and prolongation of
man's life. Concerning which two opinions I shall
forbear to add a third, and tell you, my worthy friend,
that both these meet together and do most properly
belong to the most honest, quiet, and harmless art of
angling.</p>

<p>An ingenious Spaniard says that "rivers and the inhabitants
thereof were made for wise men to contemplate,
and fools to pass by without consideration."</p>

<p>There be many wonders reported of rivers, as of a
river in Epirus, that puts out any lighted torch, and
kindles any torch that was not lighted; the river Selarus,
that in a few hours turns a rod to stone, and mention is
made of the like in England, and many others on historical
faith.</p>

<p>But to tell you something of the monsters, or fish, call
them what you will, Pliny says the fish called the BalÃ¦na
is so long and so broad as to take up more length
and breadth than two acres of ground; and in the river
Ganges there be eels thirty feet long.</p>

<p>I know we islanders are averse to the belief of these
wonders, but there are many strange creatures to be now
seen. Did not the Prophet David say, "They that occupy
themselves in deep water see the wonderful works
of God"; and the apostles of our Saviour, were not they
four simple fishermen; He found that the hearts of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
men, by nature, were fitted for contemplation and quietness&mdash;men
of sweet and peaceable spirits, as indeed most
anglers are.</p>

<p><i>Venator.</i> Sir, you have angled me on with much
pleasure to the Thatched House, for I thought we had
three miles of it. Let us drink a civil cup to all lovers of
angling, of which number I am now willing to count
myself, and if you will but meet me to-morrow at the
time and place appointed, we two will do nothing but
talk of fish and fishing.</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> 'Tis a match, sir; I will not fail you, God
willing, to be at Amwell Hill to-morrow before sun-rising.</p>

<h4><i>Master and Pupil</i></h4>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> Sir, I am right glad to meet you. Come,
honest Venator, let us be gone; I long to be doing.</p>

<p><i>Venator.</i> Well, let's to your sport of angling.</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> With all my heart. But we are not yet
come to a likely place. Let us walk on. But let us first
to an honest alehouse, where my hostess can give us a
cup of her best drink.</p>

<p>Seneca says that the ancients were so curious in the
newness of their fish, that they usually did keep them
living in glass-bottles in their dining-rooms, and did
glory much in the entertaining of their friends, to have
the fish taken from under their tables alive that was
instantly to be fed upon. Our hostess shall dress us a
trout, that we shall presently catch, and we, with brother
Peter and Goridon, will sup on him here this same
evening.</p>

<p><i>Venator.</i> And now to our sport.</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> This is not a likely place for a trout; the
sun is too high. But there lie upon the top of the water
twenty Chub. Sir, here is a trial of my skill! I'll catch
only one, and he shall be the big one, that has some
bruise upon his tail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
<i>Venator.</i> I'll sit down and hope well; because you
seem so confident.</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> Look you, sir! The very one! Oh, 'tis a
great logger-headed Chub! I'll warrant he will make a
good dish of meat.</p>

<p>Under that broad beech tree yonder, I sat down when
I was last a-fishing; and the birds in the adjoining grove
seemed to have a friendly contention with the echo that
lives in a hollow near the brow of that primrose-hill.
There I sat viewing the silver stream slide away, and
the lambs sporting harmlessly. And as I sat, these sights
so possessed my soul, that I thought as the poet hath it:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"I was for that time lifted above earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And possess'd joys not promised at my birth."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But, let us further on; and we will try for a Trout.
'Tis now past five of the clock.</p>

<p><i>Venator.</i> I have a bite! Oh me! He has broke all;
and a good hook lost! But I have no fortune! Sure
yours is a better rod and tackling.</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> Nay, then, take mine, and I will fish with
yours. Look you, scholar, I have another. I pray, put
that net under him, but touch not my line. Well done,
scholar, I thank you.</p>

<p>And now, having three brace of Trouts, I will tell
you a tale as we walk back to our hostess.</p>

<p>A preacher that was to procure the approbation of a
parish got from a fellow preacher the copy of a sermon
that was preached with great commendation by him that
composed it; and though the borrower preached it, word
for word, yet it was utterly disliked; and on complaining
to the lender of it, was thus answered: "I lent you indeed
my fiddle, but not my fiddlestick; for you are to
know, everyone cannot make music with my words,
which are fitted for my own mouth." And though I lend
you my very rod and tacklings, yet you have not my
fiddlestick, that is, the skill wherewith I guide it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
<i>Venator.</i> Master, you spoke very true. Yonder
comes mine hostess to call us to supper; and when we
have supped we will sing songs which shall give some
addition of mirth to the company.</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> And so say I; for to-morrow we meet
again up the water towards Waltham.</p>

<h4><i>Fish of English Streams</i></h4>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> Indeed, my good scholar, we may say of
angling, as Dr. Boteler said of strawberries, "Doubtless
God could have made a better berry, but doubtless God
never did"; and so, God never did make a more calm,
quiet, innocent recreation than angling.</p>

<p>And when I see how pleasantly that meadow looks;
and the earth smells so sweetly too; I think of them
as Charles the Emperor did of the City of Florence;
"that they were too pleasant to be looked on, but on
holidays."</p>

<p>To speak of fishes; the Salmon is accounted the king
of fresh-water fish. He breeds in the rivers in the month
of August, and then hastes to the sea before winter;
where he recovers his strength and comes the next summer
to the same river; for like persons of riches, he has
his summer and winter house, to spend his life in, which
is, as Sir Francis Bacon hath observed, not above ten
years.</p>

<p>The Pike, the tyrant of the fresh-waters, is said to be
the longest-lived of any fresh-water fish, but not usually
above forty years. Gesner relates of a man watering
his mule in a pond, where the Pike had devoured all the
fish, had the Pike bite his mule's lips; to which he hung
so fast, the mule did draw him out of the water. And
this same Gesner observes, that a maid in Poland washing
clothes in a pond, had a Pike bite her by the foot.
I have told you who relate these things; and shall conclude
by telling you, what a wise-man hath observed:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
"It is a hard thing to persuade the belly, because it has
no ears."</p>

<p>Besides being an eater of great voracity, the Pike is
observed to be a solitary, melancholy and a bold fish.
When he is dressed with a goodly, rich sauce, and oysters,
this dish of meat is too good for any man, but an
angler, or a very honest man.</p>

<p>The Carp, that hath only lately been naturalised in
England, is said to be the queen of rivers, and will grow
to a very great bigness; I have heard, much above a
yard long.</p>

<p>The stately Bream, and the Tench, that physician of
fishes, love best to live in ponds. In every Tench's head
are two little stones which physicians make great use of.
Rondeletius says, at his being in Rome, he saw a great
cure done by applying a Tench to the feet of a sick man.</p>

<p>But I will not meddle more with that; there are too
many meddlers in physic and divinity that think fit to
meddle with hidden secrets and so bring destruction to
their followers.</p>

<p>The Perch is a bold, biting fish, and carries his teeth
in his mouth; and to affright the Pike and save himself
he will set up his fins, like as a turkey-cock will set up
his tail. If there be twenty or forty in a hole, they
may be catched one after the other, at one standing; they
being, like the wicked of this world, not afraid, though
their fellows and companions perish in their sight.</p>

<p>And now I think best to rest myself, for I have almost
spent my spirits with talking.</p>

<p><i>Venator.</i> Nay, good master, one fish more! For it
rains yet; you know our angles are like money put to
usury; they may thrive, though we sit still. Come, the
other fish, good master!</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> But shall I nothing from you, that seem to
have both a good memory and a cheerful spirit?</p>

<p><i>Venator.</i> Yes, master; I will speak you a copy of
verses that allude to rivers and fishing:</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> I thank you for these choice verses. And I
will now tell you of the Eel, which is a most dainty fish.
The Romans have esteemed her the Helena of their
feasts. Sir Francis Bacon will allow the Eel to live
but ten years; but he mentions a Lamprey, belonging to
the Roman Emperor, that was made tame and kept for
three-score years; so that when she died, Crassus, the
orator, lamented her death.</p>

<p>I will tell you next how to make the Eel a most excellent
dish of meat.</p>

<p>First, wash him in water and salt, then pull off his
skin and clean him; then give him three or four scotches
with a knife; and then put into him sweet herbs, an
anchovy and a little nutmeg. Then pull his skin over
him, and tie him with pack-thread; and baste him with
butter, and what he drips, be his sauce. And when I
dress an Eel thus, I wish he were a yard and three-quarters
long. But they are not so proper to be talked
of by me because they make us anglers no sport.</p>

<p>The Barbel, so called by reason of his barb or wattles,
and the Gudgeon, are both fine fish of excellent
shape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
My further purpose was to give you directions concerning
Roach and Dace, but I will forbear. I see yonder,
brother Peter. But I promise you, to-morrow as
we walk towards London, if I have forgotten anything
now I will not then keep it from you.</p>

<p><i>Venator.</i> Come, we will all join together and drink a
cup to our jovial host, and so to bed. I say good-night
to everybody.</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> And so say I.</p>

<h4><i>Walking Homewards</i></h4>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> I will tell you, my honest scholar, I once
heard one say, "I envy not him that eats better meat,
or wears better clothes than I do; I envy him only that
catches more fish than I do."</p>

<p>And there be other little fish that I had almost forgot,
such as the Minnow or Penk; the dainty Loach; the
Miller's-Thumb, of no pleasing shape; the Stickle-bag,
good only to make sport for boys and women anglers.</p>

<p>Well, scholar, I could tell you many things of the rivers
of this nation, the chief of which is the Thamisis;
of fish-ponds, and how to breed fish within them, and
how to order your lines and baits for the several fishes;
but, I will tell you some of the thoughts that have possessed
my soul since we met together. And you shall
join with me in thankfulness to the Giver of every good
and perfect gift for our happiness; which may appear
the greater when we consider how many, even at this
very time, lie under the torment, and the stone, the gout,
and tooth-ache; and all these we are free from.</p>

<p>Since we met, others have met disasters, some have
been blasted, and we have been free from these. What
is a far greater mercy, we are free from the insupportable
burden of an accusing conscience.</p>

<p>Let me tell you, there be many that have forty times
our estates, that would give the greatest part of it to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
healthful and cheerful like us; who have eat, and drank,
and laughed, and angled, and sung, and slept; and rose
next day, and cast away care, and sung, and laughed, and
angled again.</p>

<p>I have a rich neighbour that is always so busy that
he has no leisure to laugh. He says that Solomon says,
"The diligent man makest rich"; but, he considers not
what was wisely said by a man of great observation,
"That there be as many miseries beyond riches, as on
this side them."</p>

<p>Let me tell you, scholar, Diogenes walked one day
through a country fair, where he saw ribbons, and looking-glasses,
and nut-crackers, and fiddles, and many other
gimcracks; and said to his friend, "Lord, how many
things are there in this world Diogenes hath no need!"</p>

<p>All this is told you to incline you to thankfulness:
though the prophet David was guilty of murder and
many other of the most deadly sins, yet he was said to be
a man after God's own heart, because he abounded with
thankfulness.</p>

<p>Well, scholar, I have almost tired myself, and I fear,
more than tired you.</p>

<p>But, I now see Tottenham High Cross, which puts a
period to our too long discourse, in which my meaning
was to plant that in your mind with which I labour to
possess my own soul&mdash;that is, a meek and thankful heart.
And, to that end, I have showed you that riches without
them do not make a man happy. But riches with them
remove many fears and cares. Therefore, my advice is,
that you endeavour to be honestly rich, or contentedly
poor; but be sure your riches be justly got; for it is well
said by Caussin, "He that loses his conscience, has
nothing left that is worth the keeping." So look to that.
And in the next place, look to your health, for health is
a blessing that money cannot buy. As for money, neglect
it not, and, if you have a competence, enjoy it with a
cheerful, thankful heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
<i>Venator.</i> Well, master, I thank you for all your good
directions, and especially for this last, of thankfulness.
And now being at Tottenham High Cross, I will requite
a part of your courtesies with a drink composed of sack,
milk, oranges, and sugar, which, all put together, make a
drink like nectar indeed; and too good for anybody, but
us anglers. So, here is a full glass to you.</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> And I to you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Venator.</i> Sir, your company and discourse have been
so pleasant that I truly say, that I have only lived since
I enjoyed it an turned angler, and not before.</p>

<p>I will not forget the doctrines Socrates taught his
scholars, that they should not think to be honoured for
being philosophers, so much as to honour philosophy by
the virtue of their lives. You advised me to the like
concerning angling, and to live like those same worthy
men. And this is my firm resolution.</p>

<p>And when I would beget content, I will walk the meadows,
by some gliding stream, and there contemplate the
lilies that take no care. That is my purpose; and so,
"let the blessing of St. Peter's Master be with mine."</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i> And upon all that are lovers of virtue, and
be quiet, and go a-angling.</p>

<p>Links to those volumes have been included for use on devices that
support them. The links are to the volumes, not to the specific pages.
However, references to this volume (XX) are linked to the pages. No
links are given for volumes XVI and XVIII, as they were not available
at Project Gutenberg when this eBook was produced.</p>

<p>Punctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found for the same author in this book; otherwise
they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced
quotation marks corrected in simple situations, otherwise unchanged.</p>

<p>Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.</p>

<p>Editor's comments at the beginning of each Chapter originally were
printed at the bottom of the page, but have been repositioned here
to appear just below the Chapter titles.</p>

<p>This eBook contains references to other volumes in this series, most of
which are available at no charge from Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>Page &nbsp; <a href="#Page_49">49</a>: "corollory" was printed that way.</p>

<p>Page &nbsp; <a href="#Page_80">80</a>: "than an hours spent" was printed that way.</p>

<p>Page &nbsp; <a href="#Page_148">148</a>: "perserver" may be a misprint for "preserver".</p>

<p>Page &nbsp; <a href="#Page_163">163</a>: "Circeronianus" was printed that way.</p>

<p>Page &nbsp; <a href="#Page_346">346</a>: "I enjoyed it an turned" probably is a misprint for "and".</p>
